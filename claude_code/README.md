What is Claude Code?

- **Claude Code is a command-line tool that lets you chat with Claude AI while you code. It can read your files, write code, run commands, and help you build software directly from your terminal.**
- Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI and development toolkit that brings Claude's AI capabilities directly into your coding workflow. It offers an extensible plugin system, custom slash commands, specialised subagents, agent skills, and event-driven hooks to automate development tasks. Claude Code can operate in interactive or headless mode, integrates with editors and CI systems, and connects to external tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create powerful, customisable AI-assisted development environments.
