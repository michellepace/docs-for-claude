## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know.

### Q1. Are Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD files included?

No, design assets for tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD are not included.

We don't produce high-quality design artifacts as part of our own design and development process, so building these extra resources means we can't spend as much time creating new components and templates in code which is where we believe we can provide the most value.

### Q2. What JS framework is used?

Our [website templates](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/templates) are built using Next.js, so all of the markup is written using React.

Our [components](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-blocks) are provided in three formats: React, Vue, and vanilla HTML.

The React and Vue examples are fully interactive, and are powered by [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) — a library of unstyled components we designed to integrate perfectly with Tailwind CSS.

The vanilla HTML examples **do not include any JavaScript** and are designed for people who prefer to write any necessary JavaScript themselves.

Most of the components do not rely on JS at all, but for the ones that do (dropdowns, dialogs, etc.) we've provided some simple comments in the HTML to explain things like what classes you need to use for different states (like a toggle switch being on or off), or what classes we recommend for transitioning elements on to or off of the screen (like a dialog opening).

### What version of Tailwind CSS is used?

Everything in Tailwind Plus is designed and developed for the latest version of Tailwind CSS, which is currently Tailwind CSS v4.1.
