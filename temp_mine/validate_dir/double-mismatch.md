# [Actual Correct Title](https://example.com/actual-correct-url)

Both the title and URL in INDEX.xml are wrong:

- INDEX title: "Completely Wrong Metadata" (should be "Actual Correct Title")
- INDEX URL: <https://example.com/wrong-everything> (should be <https://example.com/actual-correct-url>)

This should trigger both title and URL mismatch errors.
