Scrape $2 and add to $1 collection directory with INDEX.xml entry.

## Context

Documentation curation enables targeted, efficient context retrieval for AI agents. Rather than searching entire documentation sites, curated collections provide semantic descriptions in INDEX.xml that map specific topics to relevant markdown files.

The script scrapes content from $2, writes it to a markdown file in $1/, and adds a new `<source>` entry to INDEX.xml with a PLACEHOLDER description. Your task is to replace PLACEHOLDER with a semantic summary after successful scraping.

## Workflow

### 1. Validate arguments

You are helping a new user curate a document from source URL $2 into an existing or new collection directory $1.

**Existing collections:** !`find . -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec test -f {}/INDEX.xml \; -printf '%P\n'`

Here are just a few examples what new users can inadvertently get wrong - you are to help them do what they intend:

<validation_examples>

Examples of validation failures:

<validation_failure>

- Missing args (generic):

  ```
  ## ü§î Missing arguments!
  - Usage: `/curate-doc <collection> <url>`
  - Existing collections: `shiny`, `uv`, `tailwind`
  - Example: `/curate-doc shiny https://shiny.posit.co/py/docs/overview.html`

  [Friendly suggestion. Ask for confirmation.]
  ```

- Missing args (URL as $1, smart inference):

  ```
  ## ü§î You didn't give me a collection?
  - URL detected: `https://vite.dev/guide/cli.html`
  - My Suggestion: A new `vite` collection looks ideal!
  - Try: `/curate-doc vite https://vite.dev/guide/cli.html`

  [Shall we proceed with `vite` as a new collection? It will get created automatically üôÇ]
  ```

- Typo detection:

  ```
  ## ü§î Collection "shiyy" doesn't exist, but you have "shiny"!
  - Did you mean: `/curate-doc shiny https://example.com/docs` ?

  [Friendly suggestion. Ask for confirmation.]
  ```

- Semantic mismatch:

  ```
  ## ü§î Mmm.. are you sure you meant `shiny`?
  - Collection: `shiny`
  - URL: `https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation`
  - This appears to be Tailwind CSS docs, not Shiny
  - Did you mean: `/curate-doc tailwind https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation` ?

  [Friendly recommendation in 1-2 short sentence, ask for confirmation]
  ```

</validation_failure>

Success:

<validation_success>

```
## üôÇ Super! Scraping Shiny doc to shiny/ collection...
```

</validation_success>

</validation_examples>

Be emoji led, brief, and helpful for an overwhelmed new user. Analyse "Existing Collections" and both arguments $1 (proposed collection directory) and $2 (URL). Determine if the arguments should fail validation. Use the above examples as a guide and adapt for user experience (think emojis, structure, `highlighting`). Otherwise output a success message and proceed without confirmation.

### 2. Run the script

```bash
uv run scripts/curate_doc.py "$1" "$2"
```

### 3. On script error

Script errors print actionable information. If recovery is possible, propose specific fixes but wait for explicit user approval. Proceed ONLY when script outputs `üéâ Curation Success!` - don't waste effort if the script failed.

### 4. Generate and update description

Read the scraped markdown file and write a 20-30 word dense description following the example patterns in between `<example_description>`. In `$1/INDEX.xml`, find the `<source>` entry where `<source_url>` matches $2.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Replace ONLY the text `PLACEHOLDER` - do NOT replace the entire `<description>` tag or you will break the XML structure. After replacement, ensure description tags are matched on a single line.

<example_description>

```xml
<!-- Example 1 (single line, no line breaks) -->
<description>Next.js folder structure covering top-level folders (`app`, `pages`, `public`, `src`), routing files (`page.js`, `layout.js`, `loading.js`, `error.js`), dynamic routes, route groups, private folders, parallel/intercepted routes, colocation patterns, component hierarchy, and metadata file conventions.</description>

<!-- Example 2 (single line, no line breaks) -->
<description>Dependency fields, uv add/remove commands, dependency sources (Git, URL, path, workspace), optional dependencies, development groups, build dependencies, editable installations, and dependency specifiers syntax.</description>

<!-- Example 3 (single line, no line breaks) -->
<description>Advanced reactive patterns including `@reactive.event` and `isolate` for event-driven execution, `req` for conditional execution, `invalidate_later` for scheduled updates, `@reactive.file_reader` for monitoring files, and `@reactive.poll` for conditional polling.</description>
```

</example_description>

### 5. Report success

Output the final success message following the `<example_success_message>` format:

<example_success_message>

```
## üéâ Curation Success!
