What is Clerk?

- **Clerk handles user sign-up, login, and account management for your web app. It provides ready-to-use components for authentication, user profiles, and team organisations that work with frameworks like Next.js.**
- Clerk is a complete user authentication and management platform for modern web applications. It provides prebuilt UI components, session management, and organisation features that integrate seamlessly with frameworks like Next.js, handling everything from sign-in flows and multi-factor authentication to user profiles and role-based permissions. Clerk uses a hybrid authentication model that combines the scalability benefits of stateless JWT tokens with the security advantages of stateful sessions, automatically refreshing short-lived tokens to maintain both performance and security.
