# Buy a domain

### Using CLI?

Use this snippet to purchase a new domain from Vercel:

terminal

```
vercel domains buy [domain]
```

Use Vercel to find and buy a domain that resonates with your brand, establishes credibility, and captures your visitors' attention.

All domains purchased on Vercel have WHOIS privacy enabled by default.

1. ### [Find a domain](#find-a-domain)

    Go to [https://vercel.com/domains](/domains) and search for a domain that matches you or your brand. You could try "SuperDev"!

    Depending on the TLD (top-level domain), you’ll see the purchase price. Domains with Premium badges are more expensive. You can sort the results by relevance (default), length, price, or alphabetical order.

2. ### [Select your domain(s)](#select-your-domains)

    * Select an address by clicking the button next to the available domain, or continue searching until you find the perfect one.
    * When you click the button, Vercel adds the domain to your domains cart. You can continue to add more domains from the same results or search for new ones.

3. ### [Purchase your domain(s)](#purchase-your-domains)

    * Click on the Cart button on the top right and review the list of domains and prices that you added.
    * Then, click Proceed to Checkout. You can also change the Team under which you are making this purchase at this stage.

4. ### [Enter payment details and registrant information](#enter-payment-details-and-registrant-information)

    * You'll need to enter your billing and credit card details to purchase the domain on the checkout page. These details are saved for [auto renewal](/docs/domains/renew-a-domain).
    * You'll also need to enter your registrant information and confirm it for [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/) purposes.
    * Click Buy to complete the purchase.

    For the ICANN registrant information:

    * If you enter the same email address you use for your Vercel user account (or an email your [team Owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) uses), the information will be confirmed automatically.

    * If you enter another email address, please follow the instructions you receive in an email to confirm your registrant information.

5. ### [Configure your domain](#configure-your-domain)

    * Once the purchase is complete, you can click Configure next to each purchased domain on the checkout page.
    * You'll have the following options:
        * Connect the domain to an existing project
        * Create a new project to connect the domain to
        * Manage the domain's DNS records

    You can also configure your domain from the [project's domains dashboard page](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdomains&title=Go+to+your+project%27s+domain) by following the [Add and configure domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain) instructions.
