## [Hobby billing cycle](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/hobby\#hobby-billing-cycle)

As the Hobby plan is a free tier there are no billing cycles. In most cases, if you exceed your usage limits on the Hobby plan, you will have to wait until 30 days have passed before you can use the feature again.

Some features have shorter or longer time periods:

- [Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing#hobby)

As stated in the [fair use guidelines](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines#commercial-usage), the Hobby plan restricts users to non-commercial, personal use only.

When your personal account gets converted to a Hobby team, your usage and activity log will be reset. To learn more about this change, read the [changelog](https://vercel.com/changelog/2024-01-account-changes).
