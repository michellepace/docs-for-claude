# Projects and deployments

To get started with Vercel, it's helpful to understand projects and deployments:

* Projects: A [project](/docs/projects/overview) is the application that you have deployed to Vercel. You can have multiple projects connected to a single repository (for example, a [monorepo](/docs/monorepos)), and multiple [deployments](/docs/deployments) for each project. You can view all your projects on the [dashboard](/dashboard), and configure your settings through the [project dashboard](/docs/projects/project-dashboard).
* Deployments: A [deployment](/docs/deployments) is the result of a successful [build](/docs/deployments/builds#) of your project. A deployment is triggered when you import an existing project or template, or when you push a Git commit through your [connected integration](/docs/git) or use `vercel deploy` from the [CLI](/docs/cli). Every deployment [generates a URL automatically](/docs/deployments/generated-urls).

To get started you'll create a new project by either deploying a template or importing and deploying an existing project:

* [Import an existing project](/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/import)
