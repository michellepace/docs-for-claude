# Vercel Legacy Pro Plan

The legacy Pro plan is available for existing customers and offers fixed resource limits with traditional billing. It includes team collaboration features, email support, and increased limits compared to Hobby. You are encouraged to choose the [new Pro plan](/docs/plans/pro-plan) for better flexibility and enhanced features.

This legacy Pro plan is still supported, but all teams will move to the [new pricing model](/docs/plans/pro-plan) later this year. [Follow this guide](/docs/plans/pro-plan/switching) to switch early. New Pro teams will be on this pricing model automatically.

## [Team seats](#team-seats)

The Pro plan costs $20 per month per team seat. This means that each user on your team is billed $20 per user / month, including the first seat. A seat refers to any account linked to your Vercel team. You can add or remove team members at any time.

### [Pro plan roles](#pro-plan-roles)

The Pro plan includes access to the following [team level](/docs/rbac/access-roles#team-level-roles) [RBAC](/docs/rbac/access-roles) roles:

* [Owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role)
* [Member](/docs/rbac/access-roles#member-role)
* [Billing](/docs/rbac/access-roles#billing-role)

## [Pro plan pricing](#pro-plan-pricing)

The Pro plan is billed monthly based on the number of team seats, and the resource usage consumed by your team during the billing period. Each product has its own pricing structure, and includes both included resources and extra usage charges.

See the [Pricing](/docs/pricing) page for more information.

## [Downgrading to Hobby](#downgrading-to-hobby)

Each account is limited to one team on the Hobby plan. If you attempt to downgrade a Pro team while already having a Hobby team, the platform will either require one team to be deleted or the two teams to be merged.

To downgrade from a Pro to Hobby plan without losing access to the team's projects:

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](/dashboard) and select your team from the [scope selector](/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector)
2. Select the Settings tab
3. Select Billing in the Settings navigation
4. Click "Downgrade Plan" in the Plan sub-section

When you downgrade a Pro team, all active members except for the original owner are removed.

Due to restrictions in the downgrade flow, Pro teams will need to [manually transfer any connected Stores](/docs/storage#transferring-your-store) and/or [Domains](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/transfer-your-domain#transferring-domains-between-projects) to a new destination before proceeding with downgrade.
