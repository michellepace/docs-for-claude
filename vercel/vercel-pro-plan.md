# Vercel Pro Plan - Hello Test

The Vercel Pro plan is designed for professional developers, freelancers, and businesses who need enhanced features and team collaboration.

Teams created on or after September 9, 2025, will be on this pricing model
automatically. Teams on the [legacy Pro plan](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro) are still
supported, but will be moved to the new pricing model later this year. [Follow\\
this guide](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan/switching) to switch early.

## [Pro plan features](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#pro-plan-features)

- [Credit-based billing](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan#monthly-credit): Pro includes monthly credit that can be used flexibly across [usage dimensions](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing#managed-infrastructure-billable-resources)
- [Free viewer seats](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan#viewer-team-seat): Unlimited read-only access to the Vercel dashboard for team collaboration
- [Paid add-ons](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan#paid-add-ons): Additional enterprise-grade features are available as add-ons

For a full breakdown of the features included in the Pro plan, see the [pricing page](https://vercel.com/pricing).

## [Monthly credit](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#monthly-credit)

Every Pro plan comes with $20 in monthly credit. You can use your monthly credit across all infrastructure resources. Once you have used your monthly credit, Vercel bills additional usage on-demand.

The monthly credit applies to all [managed infrastructure billable resources](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing#managed-infrastructure-billable-resources) after their respective included allocations are exceeded.

### [Credit and usage allocation](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#credit-and-usage-allocation)

- Monthly credit: Every Pro plan has $20 in monthly credit.
- Included infrastructure usage: Each month, you have 1 TB [Fast Data Transfer](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/manage-usage#fast-data-transfer) and 10,000,000 [Edge Requests](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/manage-usage#edge-requests) included. Once you exceed these included allocations, Vercel will charge usage against your monthly credit before switching to on-demand billing.

### [Credit expiration](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#credit-expiration)

The credit and allocations expire at the end of the month if they are not used, and are reset at the beginning of the following month.

### [Managing your spend amount](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#managing-your-spend-amount)

You will receive automatic notifications when your usage has reached 75% of your monthly credit. Once you exceed the monthly credit, Vercel switches your team to on-demand usage and you will receive daily and weekly summary emails of your usage.

You can also set up alerts and automatic actions when your account hits a certain spend threshold as described in the [spend management documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/spend-management). This can be useful to manage your spend amount once you have used your included credit.

By default, Vercel enables spend management notifications for new customers at
a spend amount of $200 per billing cycle.

## [Team seats](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#team-seats)

On the Pro plan, your team starts with 1 included paid seat that can deploy projects, manage the team, and access all member-level permissions.

You can add (See the [Managing Team Members documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/managing-team-members#adding-team-members-and-assigning-roles) for more information):

- Additional paid seats ( [Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) or [Member](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#member-role) roles) for $20/month each
- Unlimited free [Viewer seats](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan#viewer-team-seat) with read-only access

See the [Team Level Roles Reference](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles/team-level-roles) for a complete list of roles and their permissions.

## [Viewer team seat](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#viewer-team-seat)

Each viewer team seat has the [Viewer Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#viewer-pro-role) role with the following access:

- Read-only access to Vercel to view analytics, speed insights, or access project deployments
- Ability to comment and collaborate on deployed previews

Viewers cannot configure or deploy projects.

## [Pro plan pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#pro-plan-pricing)

The Pro plan is billed monthly based on the number of deploying team seats, paid add-ons, and any on-demand usage during the billing period. Each product has its own pricing structure, and includes both included resources and extra usage charges.

## [Platform fee](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#platform-fee)

- $20/month Pro platform fee
  - 1 deploying team seat included
  - $20/month in usage credit

See the [pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing) page for more information about the pricing for resource usage.

### [Additional team seats](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#additional-team-seats)

- Seats with [Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) or [Member](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#member-role) roles: $20/month each
  - These team seats have the ability to configure & deploy projects
- [Viewer Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/rbac/access-roles#viewer-pro-role) (read-only) seats: Free

## [Paid add-ons](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#paid-add-ons)

The following features are available as add-ons:

- [SAML Single Sign-On](https://vercel.com/docs/saml): $300/month
- [HIPAA BAA](https://vercel.com/docs/security/compliance#hipaa): Healthcare compliance agreements for $350/month

- [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights): $10/month per project

## [Downgrading to Hobby](https://vercel.com/docs/plans/pro-plan\#downgrading-to-hobby)

Each account is limited to one team on the Hobby plan. If you attempt to downgrade a Pro team while already having a Hobby team, the platform will either require one team to be deleted or the two teams to be merged.

To downgrade from a Pro to Hobby plan without losing access to the team's projects:

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and select your team from the [scope selector](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector)
2. Select the Settings tab
3. Select Billing in the Settings navigation
4. Click Downgrade Plan in the Plan sub-section

When you downgrade a Pro team, all active members except for the original owner are removed.

Due to restrictions in the downgrade flow, Pro teams will need to [manually transfer any connected Stores](https://vercel.com/docs/storage#transferring-your-store) and/or [Domains](https://vercel.com/docs/domains/working-with-domains/transfer-your-domain#transferring-domains-between-projects) to a new destination before proceeding with downgrade.
