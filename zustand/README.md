What is Zustand?

- **Zustand is a simple state management library for React. It lets you share data between components without complex setup – just create a store and use it with a hook.**
- Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React applications that uses a hook-based API to create and consume state without requiring context providers. It provides a simple, unopinionated approach where you define stores containing both state and actions, then bind components using selectors that automatically trigger re-renders when selected state changes. The library handles common React pitfalls like zombie child problems and React concurrency issues, whilst supporting middleware for persistence, debugging, and immutable state updates.
