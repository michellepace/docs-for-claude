# Installation [¶](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/\#installation "Permanent link")

Before installing marimo, we recommend creating and activating a Python
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).

Setting up a virtual environment

Python uses virtual environments to minimize conflicts among packages.
Here's a quickstart for `pip` users. If you use `conda`, please use a [`conda`\\
environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
instead.

Run the following in the terminal:

- create an environment with `python -m venv marimo-env`
- activate the environment:
- macOS/Unix: `source marimo-env/bin/activate`
- Windows: `marimo-env\Scripts\activate`

_Make sure the environment is activated before installing marimo and when_
_using marimo._ Install other packages you may need, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib,
and altair, in this environment. When you're done, deactivate the environment
with `deactivate` in the terminal.

Learn more from the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).

Using uv?

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a next-generation Python package
installer and manager that is 10-100x faster than pip, and also makes it easy
to install Python and manage projects. Create a [uv\\
project](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) with `uv init`; this
creates and manages a virtual environment for you behind-the-scenes. For
detailed information on using marimo with `uv`, see our [uv\\
guide](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_management/using_uv/).

## Install with minimal dependencies [¶](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/\#install-with-minimal-dependencies "Permanent link")

To install marimo, run the following in a terminal:

[install with pip](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/#__tabbed_1_1)[install with uv](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2)[install with conda](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/#__tabbed_1_3)

```bash
pip install marimo
```

To check if the install worked, run

```bash
marimo tutorial intro
```

```bash
uv add marimo
```

To check if the install worked, run

```bash
uv run marimo tutorial intro
```

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge marimo
```

To check if the install worked, run

```bash
marimo tutorial intro
```

A tutorial notebook should open in your browser.

## Install with recommended dependencies [¶](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/\#install-with-recommended-dependencies "Permanent link")

marimo is lightweight, with few dependencies, to maximize compatibility with
your own environments.

To unlock additional features in the marimo editor, including SQL cells,
AI completion, server-side plotting of dataframe columns, and more, we
suggest installing `marimo[recommended]`:

[install with pip](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/#__tabbed_2_1)[install with uv](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/#__tabbed_2_2)[install with conda](https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/installation/#__tabbed_2_3)

```bash
pip install "marimo[recommended]"
```

```bash
uv add "marimo[recommended]"
```

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge marimo "duckdb>=1.0.0" "altair>=5.4.0" pyarrow "polars>=1.9.0" "sqlglot[rs]>=23.4" "openai>=1.55.3" "ruff" "nbformat>=5.7.0" "vegafusion>=2.0.0" "vl-convert-python>=1.0.0"
```

Installing marimo in this way installs the following additional dependencies and unlocks the following features:

| Dependency | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| duckdb>=1.0.0 | SQL cells |
| altair>=5.4.0 | Plotting in datasource viewer |
| polars\[pyarrow\]>=1.9.0 | SQL output back in Python |
| sqlglot\[rs\]>=23.4 | SQL cells parsing |
| openai>=1.55.3 | AI features |
| ruff | Formatting |
| nbformat>=5.7.0 | Export as IPYNB |
| vegafusion>=2.0.0 | Performant charting |
| vl-convert-python>=1.0.0 | Required by vegafusion |
