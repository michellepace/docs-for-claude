What is Marimo?

- **Marimo is a Python notebook that updates automatically when you change your code. Your notebooks are saved as regular Python files, so they work with Git and can run as scripts or web apps.**
- Marimo is a reactive Python notebook environment that automatically runs dependent cells when you modify code or interact with UI elements, ensuring your notebook remains consistent and free from hidden state. Unlike traditional notebooks, marimo notebooks are stored as pure Python files that can be executed as scripts, deployed as interactive web applications, and version-controlled with Git. It includes built-in support for SQL queries, interactive dataframes, AI-assisted code generation, and a modern editor experience with features like package management and deterministic execution.
