What is Biome?

- **Biome is a fast tool that formats and lints your code. It replaces ESLint and Prettier with a single command that works with JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and more.**
- Biome is a fast, unified toolchain for formatting and linting JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, JSON, CSS, HTML, and other web languages. It provides a single command-line tool that can format code, enforce code quality rules, and organise imports, replacing the need for separate tools like ESLint and Prettier. Biome integrates with popular editors, continuous integration systems, and git workflows, offering zero-configuration setup with optional customisation through a simple configuration file.
