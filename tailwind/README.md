What is Tailwind?

- **Tailwind CSS lets you style websites by adding pre-made classes directly to your HTML. Instead of writing CSS files, you use classes like `flex`, `text-center`, and `bg-blue-500` to design your pages.**
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables you to build custom user interfaces by composing small, single-purpose classes directly in your HTML markup. Rather than writing custom CSS, you apply pre-built utility classes like `flex`, `bg-blue-500`, and `hover:underline` to style elements, with support for responsive breakpoints, dark mode, and arbitrary values when needed.
