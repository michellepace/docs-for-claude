Core concepts

# Hover, focus, and other states

Using utilities to style elements on hover, focus, and more.

Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied _conditionally_ by adding a variant to the beginning of the class name that describes the condition you want to target.

For example, to apply the `bg-sky-700` class on hover, use the `hover:bg-sky-700` class:

Hover over this button to see the background color change

Save changes

```
<button class="bg-sky-500 hover:bg-sky-700 ...">Save changes</button>
```

How does this compare to traditional CSS?

When writing CSS the traditional way, a single class name would do different things based on the current state:

Traditionally the same class name applies different styles on hover

```
.btn-primary {  background-color: #0ea5e9;}.btn-primary:hover {  background-color: #0369a1;}
```

In Tailwind, rather than adding the styles for a hover state to an existing class, you add another class to the element that _only_ does something on hover:

In Tailwind, separate classes are used for the default state and the hover state

```
.bg-sky-500 {  background-color: #0ea5e9;}.hover\:bg-sky-700:hover {  background-color: #0369a1;}
```

Notice how `hover:bg-sky-700` _only_ defines styles for the `:hover` state? It does nothing by default, but as soon as you hover over an element with that class, the background color will change to `sky-700`.

This is what we mean when we say a utility class can be applied _conditionally_ — by using variants you can control exactly how your design behaves in different states, without ever leaving your HTML.

Tailwind includes variants for just about everything you'll ever need, including:

- [Pseudo-classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#pseudo-classes), like `:hover`, `:focus`, `:first-child`, and `:required`
- [Pseudo-elements](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#pseudo-elements), like `::before`, `::after`, `::placeholder`, and `::selection`
- [Media and feature queries](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#media-and-feature-queries), like responsive breakpoints, dark mode, and `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [Attribute selectors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#attribute-selectors), like `[dir="rtl"]` and `[open]`
- [Child selectors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#child-selectors), like `& > *` and `& *`

These variants can even be stacked to target more specific situations, for example changing the background color in dark mode, at the medium breakpoint, on hover:

```
<button class="dark:md:hover:bg-fuchsia-600 ...">Save changes</button>
```

In this guide you'll learn about every variant available in the framework, how to use them with your own custom classes, and even how to create your own.

## [Pseudo-classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#pseudo-classes)

### [:hover, :focus, and :active](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#hover-focus-and-active)

Style elements on hover, focus, and active using the `hover`, `focus`, and `active` variants:

Try interacting with this button to see the hover, focus, and active states

Save changes

```
<button class="bg-violet-500 hover:bg-violet-600 focus:outline-2 focus:outline-offset-2 focus:outline-violet-500 active:bg-violet-700 ...">  Save changes</button>
```

Tailwind also includes variants for other interactive states like `:visited`, `:focus-within`, `:focus-visible`, and more.

See the [pseudo-class reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#pseudo-class-reference) for a complete list of available pseudo-class variants.

### [:first, :last, :odd, and :even](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#first-last-odd-and-even)

Style an element when it is the first-child or last-child using the `first` and `last` variants:

```
<ul role="list">  {#each people as person}    <!-- Remove top/bottom padding when first/last child -->    <li class="flex py-4 first:pt-0 last:pb-0">      <img class="h-10 w-10 rounded-full" src={person.imageUrl} alt="" />      <div class="ml-3 overflow-hidden">        <p class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">{person.name}</p>        <p class="truncate text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">{person.email}</p>      </div>    </li>  {/each}</ul>
```

You can also style an element when it's an odd or even child using the `odd` and `even` variants:

| Name | Title | Email |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jane Cooper | Regional Paradigm Technician | jane.cooper@example.com |
| Cody Fisher | Product Directives Officer | cody.fisher@example.com |
| Leonard Krasner | Senior Designer | leonard.krasner@example.com |
| Emily Selman | VP, Hardware Engineering | emily.selman@example.com |
| Anna Roberts | Chief Strategy Officer | anna.roberts@example.com |

```
<table>  <!-- ... -->  <tbody>    {#each people as person}      <!-- Use different background colors for odd and even rows -->      <tr class="odd:bg-white even:bg-gray-50 dark:odd:bg-gray-900/50 dark:even:bg-gray-950">        <td>{person.name}</td>        <td>{person.title}</td>        <td>{person.email}</td>      </tr>    {/each}  </tbody></table>
```

Use the `nth-*` and `nth-last-*` variants to style children based on their position in the list:

```
<div class="nth-3:underline">  <!-- ... --></div><div class="nth-last-5:underline">  <!-- ... --></div><div class="nth-of-type-4:underline">  <!-- ... --></div><div class="nth-last-of-type-6:underline">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

You can pass any number you want to these by default, and use arbitrary values for more complex expressions like `nth-[2n+1_of_li]`.

Tailwind also includes variants for other structural pseudo-classes like `:only-child`, `:first-of-type`, `:empty`, and more.

See the [pseudo-class reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#pseudo-class-reference) for a complete list of available pseudo-class variants.

### [:required and :disabled](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#required-and-disabled)

Style form elements in different states using variants like `required`, `invalid`, and `disabled`:

Try making the email address valid to see the styles change

Username

Email

Password

Save changes

```
<input  type="text"  value="tbone"  disabled  class="invalid:border-pink-500 invalid:text-pink-600 focus:border-sky-500 focus:outline focus:outline-sky-500 focus:invalid:border-pink-500 focus:invalid:outline-pink-500 disabled:border-gray-200 disabled:bg-gray-50 disabled:text-gray-500 disabled:shadow-none dark:disabled:border-gray-700 dark:disabled:bg-gray-800/20 ..."/>
```

Using variants for this sort of thing can reduce the amount of conditional logic in your templates, letting you use the same set of classes regardless of what state an input is in and letting the browser apply the right styles for you.

Tailwind also includes variants for other form states like `:read-only`, `:indeterminate`, `:checked`, and more.

See the [pseudo-class reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#pseudo-class-reference) for a complete list of available pseudo-class variants.

### [:has()](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#has)

Use the `has-*` variant to style an element based on the state or content of its descendants:

Payment method

Google PayApple PayCredit Card

```
<label  class="has-checked:bg-indigo-50 has-checked:text-indigo-900 has-checked:ring-indigo-200 dark:has-checked:bg-indigo-950 dark:has-checked:text-indigo-200 dark:has-checked:ring-indigo-900 ...">  <svg fill="currentColor">    <!-- ... -->  </svg>  Google Pay  <input type="radio" class="checked:border-indigo-500 ..." /></label>
```

You can use `has-*` with a pseudo-class, like `has-[:focus]`, to style an element based on the state of its descendants. You can also use element selectors, like `has-[img]` or `has-[a]`, to style an element based on the content of its descendants.

#### [Styling based on the descendants of a group](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#styling-based-on-the-descendants-of-a-group)

If you need to style an element based on the descendants of a parent element, you can mark the parent with the `group` class and use the `group-has-*` variant to style the target element:

```

#### [Styling based on the descendants of a peer](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#styling-based-on-the-descendants-of-a-peer)

If you need to style an element based on the descendants of a sibling element, you can mark the sibling with the `peer` class and use the `peer-has-*` variant to style the target element:

Today

Create a to do list

Check off first item

Investigate race condition

```
<div>  <label class="peer ...">    <input type="checkbox" name="todo[1]" checked />    Create a to do list  </label>  <svg class="peer-has-checked:hidden ..."><!-- ... --></svg></div>
```

### [:not()](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#not)

Use the `not-` variant to style an element when a condition is not true.

It's particularly powerful when combined with other pseudo-class variants, for example combining `not-focus:` with `hover:` to only apply hover styles when an element is not focused:

Try focusing on the button and then hovering over it

Save changes

```
<button class="bg-indigo-600 hover:not-focus:bg-indigo-700">  <!-- ... --></button>
```

You can also combine the `not-` variant with media query variants like `forced-colors` or `supports` to only style an element when something about the user's environment is not true:

```
<div class="not-supports-[display:grid]:flex">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

### [Styling based on parent state](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#styling-based-on-parent-state)

When you need to style an element based on the state of some _parent_ element, mark the parent with the `group` class, and use `group-*` variants like `group-hover` to style the target element:

Hover over the card to see both text elements change color

[New project\\
\\
Create a new project from a variety of starting templates.](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#)

```
<a href="#" class="group ...">  <div>    <svg class="stroke-sky-500 group-hover:stroke-white ..." fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24">      <!-- ... -->    </svg>    <h3 class="text-gray-900 group-hover:text-white ...">New project</h3>  </div>  <p class="text-gray-500 group-hover:text-white ...">Create a new project from a variety of starting templates.</p></a>
```

This pattern works with every pseudo-class variant, for example `group-focus`, `group-active`, or even `group-odd`.

#### [Differentiating nested groups](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#differentiating-nested-groups)

When nesting groups, you can style something based on the state of a _specific_ parent group by giving that parent a unique group name using a `group/{name}` class, and including that name in variants using classes like `group-hover/{name}`:

```

Groups can be named however you like and don’t need to be configured in any way — just name your groups directly in your markup and Tailwind will automatically generate the necessary CSS.

#### [Arbitrary groups](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#arbitrary-groups)

You can create one-off `group-*` variants on the fly by providing your own selector as an [arbitrary value](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values) between square brackets:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<div class="group is-published">  <div class="hidden group-[.is-published]:block">    Published  </div></div>
```

For more control, you can use the `&` character to mark where `.group` should end up in the final selector relative to the selector you are passing in:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<div class="group">  <div class="group-[:nth-of-type(3)_&]:block">    <!-- ... -->  </div></div>
```

#### [Implicit groups](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#implicit-groups)

The `in-*` variant works similarly to `group` except you don't need to add `group` to the parent element:

```
<div tabindex="0" class="group">  <div class="opacity-50 group-focus:opacity-100"><div tabindex="0">  <div class="opacity-50 in-focus:opacity-100">    <!-- ... -->  </div></div>
```

The `in-*` variant responds to state changes in any parent, so if you want more fine-grained control you'll need to use `group` instead.

### [Styling based on sibling state](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#styling-based-on-sibling-state)

When you need to style an element based on the state of a _sibling_ element, mark the sibling with the `peer` class, and use `peer-*` variants like `peer-invalid` to style the target element:

Try making the email address valid to see the warning disappear

Email

Please provide a valid email address.

```
<form>  <label class="block">    <span class="...">Email</span>    <input type="email" class="peer ..." />    <p class="invisible peer-invalid:visible ...">Please provide a valid email address.</p>  </label></form>
```

This makes it possible to do all sorts of neat tricks, like [floating labels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJzKi6oIvBA) for example without any JS.

This pattern works with every pseudo-class variant, for example `peer-focus`, `peer-required`, and `peer-disabled`.

It's important to note that the `peer` marker can only be used on _previous_ siblings because of how the [subsequent-sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Subsequent-sibling_combinator) works in CSS:

Won't work, only previous siblings can be marked as peers

```
<label>  <span class="peer-invalid:text-red-500 ...">Email</span>  <input type="email" class="peer ..." /></label>
```

#### [Differentiating peers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#differentiating-peers)

When using multiple peers, you can style something on the state of a _specific_ peer by giving that peer a unique name using a `peer/{name}` class, and including that name in variants using classes like `peer-checked/{name}`:

Published status

DraftPublished

Drafts are only visible to administrators.

Your post will be publicly visible on your site.

```
<fieldset>  <legend>Published status</legend>  <input id="draft" class="peer/draft" type="radio" name="status" checked />  <label for="draft" class="peer-checked/draft:text-sky-500">Draft</label>  <input id="published" class="peer/published" type="radio" name="status" />  <label for="published" class="peer-checked/published:text-sky-500">Published</label>  <div class="hidden peer-checked/draft:block">Drafts are only visible to administrators.</div>  <div class="hidden peer-checked/published:block">Your post will be publicly visible on your site.</div></fieldset>
```

Peers can be named however you like and don’t need to be configured in any way — just name your peers directly in your markup and Tailwind will automatically generate the necessary CSS.

#### [Arbitrary peers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#arbitrary-peers)

You can create one-off `peer-*` variants on the fly by providing your own selector as an [arbitrary value](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values) between square brackets:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<form>  <label for="email">Email:</label>  <input id="email" name="email" type="email" class="is-dirty peer" required />  <div class="peer-[.is-dirty]:peer-required:block hidden">This field is required.</div>  <!-- ... --></form>
```

For more control, you can use the `&` character to mark where `.peer` should end up in the final selector relative to the selector you are passing in:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<div>  <input type="text" class="peer" />  <div class="hidden peer-[:nth-of-type(3)_&]:block">    <!-- ... -->  </div></div>
```

## [Pseudo-elements](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#pseudo-elements)

### [::before and ::after](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#before-and-after)

Style the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements using the `before` and `after` variants:

Email

```
<label>  <span class="text-gray-700 after:ml-0.5 after:text-red-500 after:content-['*'] ...">Email</span>  <input type="email" name="email" class="..." placeholder="you@example.com" /></label>
```

When using these variants, Tailwind will automatically add `content: ''` by default so you don't have to specify it unless you want a different value:

> When you lookannoyedall the time, people think that you're busy.

```
<blockquote class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 italic dark:text-white">  When you look  <span class="relative inline-block before:absolute before:-inset-1 before:block before:-skew-y-3 before:bg-pink-500">    <span class="relative text-white dark:text-gray-950">annoyed</span>  </span>  all the time, people think that you're busy.</blockquote>
```

It's worth noting that you don't really need `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements for most things in Tailwind projects — it's usually simpler to just use a real HTML element.

For example, here's the same design from above but using a `<span>` instead of the `::before` pseudo-element, which is a little easier to read and is actually less code:

```
<blockquote class="text-center text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 italic">  When you look  <span class="relative">    <span class="absolute -inset-1 block -skew-y-3 bg-pink-500" aria-hidden="true"></span>    <span class="relative text-white">annoyed</span>  </span>  all the time, people think that you're busy.</blockquote>
```

Save `before` and `after` for situations where it's important that the content of the pseudo-element is not actually in the DOM and can't be selected by the user.

### [::placeholder](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#placeholder)

Style the placeholder text of any input or textarea using the `placeholder` variant:

Search

```
<input  class="placeholder:text-gray-500 placeholder:italic ..."  placeholder="Search for anything..."  type="text"  name="search"/>
```

### [::file](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#file)

Style the button in file inputs using the `file` variant:

![Current profile photo](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580489944761-15a19d654956?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1361&q=80)

Choose profile photo

```
<input  type="file"  class="file:mr-4 file:rounded-full file:border-0 file:bg-violet-50 file:px-4 file:py-2 file:text-sm file:font-semibold file:text-violet-700 hover:file:bg-violet-100 dark:file:bg-violet-600 dark:file:text-violet-100 dark:hover:file:bg-violet-500 ..."/>
```

### [::marker](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#marker)

Style the counters or bullets in lists using the `marker` variant:

## [Ingredients](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#ingredients)

- 5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms
- 1/2 cup of olive oil
- 3lb of celery

```
<ul role="list" class="list-disc marker:text-sky-400 ...">  <li>5 cups chopped Porcini mushrooms</li>  <li>1/2 cup of olive oil</li>  <li>3lb of celery</li></ul>
```

We've designed the `marker` variant to be inheritable, so although you can use it directly on an `<li>` element, you can also use it on a parent to avoid repeating yourself.

### [::selection](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#selection)

Style the active text selection using the `selection` variant:

Try selecting some of this text with your mouse

So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I _was_ a marine biologist.

```
<div class="selection:bg-fuchsia-300 selection:text-fuchsia-900">  <p>    So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my    way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all    living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.  </p></div>
```

We've designed the `selection` variant to be inheritable, so you can add it anywhere in the tree and it will be applied to all descendant elements.

This makes it easy to set the selection color to match your brand across your entire site:

```
<html>  <head>    <!-- ... -->  </head>  <body class="selection:bg-pink-300">    <!-- ... -->  </body></html>
```

### [::first-line and ::first-letter](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#first-line-and-first-letter)

Style the first line in a block of content using the `first-line` variant, and the first letter using the `first-letter` variant:

Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.

Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior.

```
<div class="text-gray-700">  <p    class="first-letter:float-left first-letter:mr-3 first-letter:text-7xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-900 first-line:tracking-widest first-line:uppercase"  >    Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"?  </p>  <p class="mt-6">Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.</p></div>
```

### [::backdrop](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#backdrop)

Style the backdrop of a [native `<dialog>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) using the `backdrop` variant:

```
<dialog class="backdrop:bg-gray-50">  <form method="dialog">    <!-- ... -->  </form></dialog>
```

If you're using native `<dialog>` elements in your project, you may also want to read about [styling open/closed states](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#openclosed-state) using the `open` variant.

## [Media and feature queries](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#media-and-feature-queries)

### [Responsive breakpoints](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#responsive-breakpoints)

To style an element at a specific breakpoint, use responsive variants like `md` and `lg`.

For example, this will render a 3-column grid on mobile, a 4-column grid on medium-width screens, and a 6-column grid on large-width screens:

```
<div class="grid grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-6">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

To style an element based on the width of a parent element instead of the viewport, use variants like `@md` and `@lg`:

```
<div class="@container">  <div class="flex flex-col @md:flex-row">    <!-- ... -->  </div></div>
```

Check out the [Responsive design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) documentation for an in-depth look at how these features work.

### [prefers-color-scheme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#prefers-color-scheme)

The `prefers-color-scheme` media query tells you whether the user prefers a light theme or dark theme, and is usually configured at the operating system level.

Use utilities with no variant to target light mode, and use the `dark` variant to provide overrides for dark mode:

Light mode

Writes upside-down

The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space.

Dark mode

Writes upside-down

The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space.

```
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 ...">  <!-- ... -->  <h3 class="text-gray-900 dark:text-white ...">Writes upside-down</h3>  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 ...">    The Zero Gravity Pen can be used to write in any orientation, including upside-down. It even works in outer space.  </p></div>
```

Check out the [Dark Mode](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) documentation for an in-depth look at how this feature works.

### [prefers-reduced-motion](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#prefers-reduced-motion)

The `prefers-reduced-motion` media query tells you if the user has requested that you minimize non-essential motion.

Use the `motion-reduce` variant to conditionally add styles when the user has requested reduced motion:

Try emulating \`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce\` in your developer tools to hide the spinner

Processing...

```
<button type="button" class="bg-indigo-500 ..." disabled>  <svg class="animate-spin motion-reduce:hidden ..." viewBox="0 0 24 24"><!-- ... --></svg>  Processing...</button>
```

Tailwind also includes a `motion-safe` variant that only adds styles when the user has _not_ requested reduced motion. This can be useful when using the `motion-reduce` helper would mean having to "undo" a lot of styles:

```
<!-- Using `motion-reduce` can mean lots of "undoing" styles --><button class="transition hover:-translate-y-0.5 motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:translate-y-0 ...">  Save changes</button><!-- Using `motion-safe` is less code in these situations --><button class="motion-safe:transition motion-safe:hover:-translate-x-0.5 ...">Save changes</button>
```

### [prefers-contrast](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#prefers-contrast)

The `prefers-contrast` media query tells you if the user has requested more or less contrast.

Use the `contrast-more` variant to conditionally add styles when the user has requested more contrast:

Try emulating \`prefers-contrast: more\` in your developer tools to see the changes

Social Security Number

We need this to steal your identity.

```
<label class="block">  <span class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Social Security Number</span>  <input    class="border-gray-200 placeholder-gray-400 contrast-more:border-gray-400 contrast-more:placeholder-gray-500 ..."  />  <p class="text-gray-600 opacity-10 contrast-more:opacity-100 ...">We need this to steal your identity.</p></label>
```

Tailwind also includes a `contrast-less` variant you can use to conditionally add styles when the user has requested less contrast.

### [forced-colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#forced-colors)

The `forced-colors` media query indicates if the user is using a forced colors mode. These modes override your site's colors with a user defined palette for text, backgrounds, links and buttons.

Use the `forced-colors` variant to conditionally add styles when the user has enabled a forced color mode:

Try emulating \`forced-colors: active\` in your developer tools to see the changes

Choose a theme:

Cyan

Blue

Indigo

Purple

```
<label>  <input type="radio" class="appearance-none forced-colors:appearance-auto" />  <p class="hidden forced-colors:block">Cyan</p>  <div class="bg-cyan-200 forced-colors:hidden ..."></div>  <div class="bg-cyan-500 forced-colors:hidden ..."></div></label>
```

Use the `not-forced-colors` variant to apply styles based when the user is _not_ using a forced colors mode:

```
<div class="not-forced-colors:appearance-none ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

Tailwind also includes a [forced color adjust](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/forced-color-adjust) utilities to opt in and out of forced colors.

### [inverted-colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#inverted-colors)

Use the `inverted-colors` variant to conditionally add styles when the user has enabled an inverted color scheme:

```
<div class="shadow-xl inverted-colors:shadow-none ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

### [pointer and any-pointer](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#pointer-and-any-pointer)

The `pointer` media query tells you whether the user has a primary pointing device, like a mouse, and the accuracy of that pointing device.

Use the `pointer-fine` variant to target an accurate pointing device, like a mouse or trackpad, or the `pointer-coarse` variant to target a less accurate pointing device, like a touchscreen, which can be useful for providing larger click targets on touch devices:

Try emulating a touch device in your developer tools to see the changes

RAM

[See performance specs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#)

4 GB8 GB16 GB32 GB64 GB128 GB

```
<fieldset aria-label="Choose a memory option">  <div class="flex items-center justify-between">    <div>RAM</div>    <a href="#"> See performance specs </a>  </div>  <div class="mt-4 grid grid-cols-6 gap-2 pointer-coarse:mt-6 pointer-coarse:grid-cols-3 pointer-coarse:gap-4">    <label class="p-2 pointer-coarse:p-4 ...">      <input type="radio" name="memory-option" value="4 GB" className="sr-only" />      <span>4 GB</span>    </label>    <!-- ... -->  </div></fieldset>
```

While `pointer` only targets the primary pointing device, `any-pointer` is used to target any of the pointing devices that might be available. Use the `any-pointer-fine` and `any-pointer-coarse` variants to provide different styles if at least one connected pointing device meets the criteria.

You can use `pointer-none` and `any-pointer-none` to target the absence of a pointing device.

### [orientation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#orientation)

Use the `portrait` and `landscape` variants to conditionally add styles when the viewport is in a specific orientation:

```
<div>  <div class="portrait:hidden">    <!-- ... -->  </div>  <div class="landscape:hidden">    <p>This experience is designed to be viewed in landscape. Please rotate your device to view the site.</p>  </div></div>
```

### [scripting](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#scripting)

Use the `noscript` variant to conditionally add styles based on whether the user has scripting, such as JavaScript, enabled:

```
<div class="hidden noscript:block">  <p>This experience requires JavaScript to function. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.</p></div>
```

### [print](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#print)

Use the `print` variant to conditionally add styles that only apply when the document is being printed:

```
<div>  <article class="print:hidden">    <h1>My Secret Pizza Recipe</h1>    <p>This recipe is a secret, and must not be shared with anyone</p>    <!-- ... -->  </article>  <div class="hidden print:block">Are you seriously trying to print this? It's secret!</div></div>
```

### [@supports](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#supports)

Use the `supports-[...]` variant to style things based on whether a certain feature is supported in the user's browser:

```
<div class="flex supports-[display:grid]:grid ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

Under the hood the `supports-[...]` variant generates [`@supports rules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports) and takes anything you’d use with `@supports (...)` between the square brackets, like a property/value pair, and even expressions using `and` and `or`.

For terseness, if you only need to check if a property is supported (and not a specific value), you can just specify the property name:

```
<div class="bg-black/75 supports-backdrop-filter:bg-black/25 supports-backdrop-filter:backdrop-blur ...">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

Use the `not-supports-[...]` variant to style things based on whether a certain feature is not supported in the user's browser:

```
<div class="not-supports-[display:grid]:flex">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

You can configure shortcuts for common `@supports` rules you're using in your project by creating a new variant in the `supports-*` namespace:

```
@custom-variant supports-grid {  @supports (display: grid) {    @slot;  }}
```

You can then use these custom `supports-*` variants in your project:

```
<div class="supports-grid:grid">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

### [@starting-style](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#starting-style)

Use the `starting` variant to set the appearance of an element when it is first rendered in the DOM, or transitions from `display: none` to visible:

```
<div>  <button popovertarget="my-popover">Check for updates</button>  <div popover id="my-popover" class="opacity-0 starting:open:opacity-0 ...">    <!-- ... -->  </div></div>
```

## [Attribute selectors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#attribute-selectors)

### [ARIA states](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#aria-states)

Use the `aria-*` variant to conditionally style things based on [ARIA attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes).

For example, to apply the `bg-sky-700` class when the `aria-checked` attribute is set to `true`, use the `aria-checked:bg-sky-700` class:

```
<div aria-checked="true" class="bg-gray-600 aria-checked:bg-sky-700">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

By default we've included variants for the most common boolean ARIA attributes:

| Variant | CSS |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-busy` | `&[aria-busy="true"]` |
| `aria-checked` | `&[aria-checked="true"]` |
| `aria-disabled` | `&[aria-disabled="true"]` |
| `aria-expanded` | `&[aria-expanded="true"]` |
| `aria-hidden` | `&[aria-hidden="true"]` |
| `aria-pressed` | `&[aria-pressed="true"]` |
| `aria-readonly` | `&[aria-readonly="true"]` |
| `aria-required` | `&[aria-required="true"]` |
| `aria-selected` | `&[aria-selected="true"]` |

You can customize which `aria-*` variants are available by creating a new variant:

```
@custom-variant aria-asc (&[aria-sort="ascending"]);@custom-variant aria-desc (&[aria-sort="descending"]);
```

If you need to use a one-off `aria` variant that doesn’t make sense to include in your project, or for more complex ARIA attributes that take specific values, use square brackets to generate a property on the fly using any arbitrary value:

| Invoice # | Client | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #100 | Pendant Publishing | $2,000.00 |
| #101 | Kruger Industrial Smoothing | $545.00 |
| #102 | J. Peterman | $10,000.25 |

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<table>  <thead>    <tr>      <th        aria-sort="ascending"        class="aria-[sort=ascending]:bg-[url('/img/down-arrow.svg')] aria-[sort=descending]:bg-[url('/img/up-arrow.svg')]"      >        Invoice #      </th>      <!-- ... -->    </tr>  </thead>  <!-- ... --></table>
```

ARIA state variants can also target parent and sibling elements using the `group-aria-*` and `peer-aria-*` variants:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<table>  <thead>    <tr>    <th aria-sort="ascending" class="group">      Invoice #      <svg class="group-aria-[sort=ascending]:rotate-0 group-aria-[sort=descending]:rotate-180"><!-- ... --></svg>    </th>    <!-- ... -->    </tr>  </thead>  <!-- ... --></table>
```

### [Data attributes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#data-attributes)

Use the `data-*` variant to conditionally apply styles based on [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes).

To check if a data attribute exists (and not a specific value), you can just specify the attribute name:

```
<!-- Will apply --><div data-active class="border border-gray-300 data-active:border-purple-500">  <!-- ... --></div><!-- Will not apply --><div class="border border-gray-300 data-active:border-purple-500">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

If you need to check for a specific value you may use an arbitrary value:

```
<!-- Will apply --><div data-size="large" class="data-[size=large]:p-8">  <!-- ... --></div><!-- Will not apply --><div data-size="medium" class="data-[size=large]:p-8">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

Alternatively, you can configure shortcuts for common data attributes you're using in your project by creating a new variant in the `data-*` namespace:

app.css

```
@import "tailwindcss";@custom-variant data-checked (&[data-ui~="checked"]);
```

You can then use these custom `data-*` variants in your project:

```
<div data-ui="checked active" class="data-checked:underline">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

### [RTL support](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#rtl-support)

Use the `rtl` and `ltr` variants to conditionally add styles in right-to-left and left-to-right modes respectively when building multi-directional layouts:

Left-to-right

```
<div class="group flex items-center">  <img class="h-12 w-12 shrink-0 rounded-full" src="..." alt="" />  <div class="ltr:ml-3 rtl:mr-3">    <p class="text-gray-700 group-hover:text-gray-900 ...">...</p>    <p class="text-gray-500 group-hover:text-gray-700 ...">...</p>  </div></div>
```

Remember, these variants are only useful if you are building a site that needs to support _both_ left-to-right and right-to-left layouts. If you're building a site that only needs to support a single direction, you don't need these variants — just apply the styles that make sense for your content.

### [Open/closed state](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#openclosed-state)

Use the `open` variant to conditionally add styles when a `<details>` or `<dialog>` element is in an open state:

Try toggling the disclosure to see the styles change

Why do they call it Ovaltine?

The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it Roundtine.

```
<details class="border border-transparent open:border-black/10 open:bg-gray-100 ..." open>  <summary class="text-sm leading-6 font-semibold text-gray-900 select-none">Why do they call it Ovaltine?</summary>  <div class="mt-3 text-sm leading-6 text-gray-600">    <p>The mug is round. The jar is round. They should call it Roundtine.</p>  </div></details>
```

This variant also targets the `:popover-open` pseudo-class for popovers:

```
<div>  <button popovertarget="my-popover">Open Popover</button>  <div popover id="my-popover" class="opacity-0 open:opacity-100 ...">    <!-- ... -->  </div></div>
```

### [Styling inert elements](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#styling-inert-elements)

The `inert` variant lets you style elements marked with the `inert` attribute:

Notification preferences

Custom

Comments

Get notified when someones posts a comment on a post.

Mentions

Get notified when someones mentions you.

Everything

```
<form>  <legend>Notification preferences</legend>  <fieldset>    <input type="radio" />    <label> Custom </label>    <fieldset inert class="inert:opacity-50">      <!-- ... -->    </fieldset>    <input type="radio" />    <label> Everything </label>  </fieldset></form>
```

This is useful for adding visual cues that make it clear that sections of content aren't interactive.

## [Child selectors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#child-selectors)

### [Styling direct children](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#styling-direct-children)

While it's generally preferable to put utility classes directly on child elements, you can use the `*` variant in situations where you need to style direct children that you don’t have control over:

## [Categories](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#categories)

Sales

Marketing

SEO

Analytics

Design

Strategy

Security

Growth

Mobile

UX/UI

```
<div>  <h2>Categories<h2>  <ul class="*:rounded-full *:border *:border-sky-100 *:bg-sky-50 *:px-2 *:py-0.5 dark:text-sky-300 dark:*:border-sky-500/15 dark:*:bg-sky-500/10 ...">    <li>Sales</li>    <li>Marketing</li>    <li>SEO</li>    <!-- ... -->  </ul></div>
```

It's important to note that overriding a style with a utility directly on the child itself won't work since children rules are generated after the regular ones and they have the same specificity:

Won't work, children can't override styles given to them by the parent.

```
<ul class="*:bg-sky-50 ...">  <li class="bg-red-50 ...">Sales</li>  <li>Marketing</li>  <li>SEO</li>  <!-- ... --></ul>
```

### [Styling all descendants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#styling-all-descendants)

Like `*`, the `**` variant can be used to style children of an element. The main difference is that `**` will apply styles to _all_ descendants, not just the direct children. This is especially useful when you combine it with another variant for narrowing the thing you're selecting:

```

## [Custom variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#custom-variants)

### [Using arbitrary variants](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#using-arbitrary-variants)

Just like [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values) let you use custom values with your utility classes, arbitrary variants let you write custom selector variants directly in your HTML.

Arbitrary variants are just format strings that represent the selector, wrapped in square brackets. For example, this arbitrary variant changes the cursor to `grabbing` when the element has the `is-dragging` class:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<ul role="list">  {#each items as item}    <li class="[&.is-dragging]:cursor-grabbing">{item}</li>  {/each}</ul>
```

Arbitrary variants can be stacked with built-in variants or with each other, just like the rest of the variants in Tailwind:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<ul role="list">  {#each items as item}    <li class="[&.is-dragging]:active:cursor-grabbing">{item}</li>  {/each}</ul>
```

If you need spaces in your selector, you can use an underscore. For example, this arbitrary variant selects all `p` elements within the element where you've added the class:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<div class="[&_p]:mt-4">  <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>  <ul>    <li>      <p>Lorem ipsum...</p>    </li>    <!-- ... -->  </ul></div>
```

You can also use at-rules like `@media` or `@supports` in arbitrary variants:

HTML

Generated CSS

```
<div class="flex [@supports(display:grid)]:grid">  <!-- ... --></div>
```

With at-rule custom variants the `&` placeholder isn't necessary, just like when nesting with a preprocessor.

### [Registering a custom variant](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states\#registering-a-custom-variant)

If you find yourself using the same arbitrary variant multiple times in your project, it might be worth creating a custom variant using the `@custom-variant` directive:

```
@custom-variant theme-midnight (&:where([data-theme="midnight"] *));
```

Now you can use the `theme-midnight:<utility>` variant in your HTML:

```
<html data-theme="midnight">  <button class="theme-midnight:bg-black ..."></button></html>
```

Learn more about adding custom variants in the [adding custom variants documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#adding-custom-variants).
