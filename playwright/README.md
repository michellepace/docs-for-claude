What is Playwright?

- **Playwright lets you write tests that control a real browser to check your web app works correctly. It runs tests on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and waits for pages to load so your tests don't fail randomly.**
- Playwright is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications that enables reliable automation across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. It provides automatic waiting for elements to be actionable, powerful locators for finding page elements, and async matchers that eliminate flaky tests. Playwright includes built-in features for test generation, trace viewing, parallelisation, and continuous integration, making it straightforward to write and maintain comprehensive browser tests.
