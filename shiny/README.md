What is Shiny?

- **Shiny for Python lets you build interactive web dashboards using only Python – no JavaScript needed. Your charts and tables update automatically when users interact with filters, sliders, and other controls.**
- Shiny for Python is a reactive framework for building interactive data dashboards and web applications entirely in Python, without requiring JavaScript knowledge. It provides a comprehensive set of input widgets, output displays, and layout components that automatically update when data changes through its reactive programming model. Shiny includes built-in theming, AI integration capabilities, and extensibility through web standards, making it ideal for data scientists and analysts who want to create sophisticated interactive applications quickly.
