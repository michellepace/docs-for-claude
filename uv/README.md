What is uv?

- **uv is a fast tool for managing Python projects and packages. It installs dependencies, creates virtual environments, and handles Python versions – replacing several tools with one simple command.**
- uv is a fast, all-in-one Python package and project manager developed by Astral that handles Python version management, dependency installation, project initialisation, and virtual environment creation. It provides a modern, unified interface for tasks typically handled by multiple tools like pip, virtualenv, pyenv, and pip-tools, with significantly faster performance and project workflows centred around `pyproject.toml` and automatic lockfiles.
