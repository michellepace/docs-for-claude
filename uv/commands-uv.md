### Options

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See `--project` to only change the project root directory.

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

The keyring provider to use for storage of credentials.

Only `--keyring-provider native` is supported for `login`, which uses the system keyring via an integration built into uv.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-config`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--no-config)

Avoid discovering configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--password`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--password) _password_

The password to use for the service.

Use `-` to read the password from stdin.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--token`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--token), `-t` _token_

The token to use for the service.

The username will be set to `__token__`.

Use `-` to read the token from stdin.

[`--username`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--username), `-u` _username_

The username to use for the service

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-login--verbose), `-v`

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-config`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--no-config)

Avoid discovering configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-auth-dir--verbose), `-v`

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

## [uv run](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-run)

Run a command or script.

Ensures that the command runs in a Python environment.

When used with a file ending in `.py` or an HTTP(S) URL, the file will be treated as a script and run with a Python interpreter, i.e., `uv run file.py` is equivalent to `uv run python file.py`. For URLs, the script is temporarily downloaded before execution. If the script contains inline dependency metadata, it will be installed into an isolated, ephemeral environment. When used with `-`, the input will be read from stdin, and treated as a Python script.

When used in a project, the project environment will be created and updated before invoking the command.

When used outside a project, if a virtual environment can be found in the current directory or a parent directory, the command will be run in that environment. Otherwise, the command will be run in the environment of the discovered interpreter.

Arguments following the command (or script) are not interpreted as arguments to uv. All options to uv must be provided before the command, e.g., `uv run --verbose foo`. A `--` can be used to separate the command from uv options for clarity, e.g., `uv run --python 3.12 -- python`.

### Usage

```
uv run [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

### Options

[`--active`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--active)

Prefer the active virtual environment over the project's virtual environment.

If the project virtual environment is active or no virtual environment is active, this has no effect.

[`--all-extras`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--all-extras)

Include all optional dependencies.

Optional dependencies are defined via `project.optional-dependencies` in a `pyproject.toml`.

This option is only available when running in a project.

[`--all-groups`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--all-groups)

Include dependencies from all dependency groups.

`--no-group` can be used to exclude specific groups.

[`--all-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--all-packages)

Run the command with all workspace members installed.

The workspace's environment (`.venv`) is updated to include all workspace members.

Any extras or groups specified via `--extra`, `--group`, or related options will be applied to all workspace members.

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--exclude-newer-package) _exclude-newer-package_

Limit candidate packages for specific packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--extra) _extra_

May be provided more than once.

Optional dependencies are defined via `project.optional-dependencies` in a `pyproject.toml`.

This option is only available when running in a project.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--frozen`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--frozen)

Run without updating the `uv.lock` file.

Instead of checking if the lockfile is up-to-date, uses the versions in the lockfile as the source of truth. If the lockfile is missing, uv will exit with an error. If the `pyproject.toml` includes changes to dependencies that have not been included in the lockfile yet, they will not be present in the environment.

May also be set with the `UV_FROZEN` environment variable.

[`--group`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--group) _group_

Include dependencies from the specified dependency group.

May be provided multiple times.

Using `--gui-script` will attempt to parse the path as a PEP 723 script and run it with `pythonw.exe`, irrespective of its extension. Only available on Windows.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--isolated`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--isolated)

Run the command in an isolated virtual environment.

Usually, the project environment is reused for performance. This option forces a fresh environment to be used for the project, enforcing strict isolation between dependencies and declaration of requirements.

An editable installation is still used for the project.

When used with `--with` or `--with-requirements`, the additional dependencies will still be layered in a second environment.

May also be set with the `UV_ISOLATED` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--locked`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--locked)

Assert that the `uv.lock` will remain unchanged.

Requires that the lockfile is up-to-date. If the lockfile is missing or needs to be updated, uv will exit with an error.

May also be set with the `UV_LOCKED` environment variable.

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--managed-python)

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--python), `-p` _python_

[`--python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--python-platform) _python-platform_

The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the _target_ platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the _current_ platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the _target_ platform, as they will be built for the _current_ platform. The `--python-platform` option is intended for advanced use cases.

[`--with-editable`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--with-editable) _with-editable_

Run with the given packages installed in editable mode.

When used in a project, these dependencies will be layered on top of the project environment in a separate, ephemeral environment. These dependencies are allowed to conflict with those specified by the project.

[`--with-requirements`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-run--with-requirements) _with-requirements_

Run with the packages listed in the given files.

The following formats are supported: `requirements.txt`, `.py` files with inline metadata, and `pylock.toml`.

## [uv init](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-init)

Create a new project.

Follows the `pyproject.toml` specification.

If a `pyproject.toml` already exists at the target, uv will exit with an error.

If a `pyproject.toml` is found in any of the parent directories of the target path, the project will be added as a workspace member of the parent.

Some project state is not created until needed, e.g., the project virtual environment (`.venv`) and lockfile (`uv.lock`) are lazily created during the first sync.

### Usage

```
uv init [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

### Arguments

[PATH](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--path)

The path to use for the project/script.

Defaults to the current working directory when initializing an app or library; required when initializing a script. Accepts relative and absolute paths.

If a `pyproject.toml` is found in any of the parent directories of the target path, the project will be added as a workspace member of the parent, unless `--no-workspace` is provided.

### Options

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--app`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--app), `--application`

Create a project for an application.

This is the default behavior if `--lib` is not requested.

This project kind is for web servers, scripts, and command-line interfaces.

By default, an application is not intended to be built and distributed as a Python package. The `--package` option can be used to create an application that is distributable, e.g., if you want to distribute a command-line interface via PyPI.

[`--author-from`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--author-from) _author-from_

Fill in the `authors` field in the `pyproject.toml`.

By default, uv will attempt to infer the author information from some sources (e.g., Git) (`auto`). Use `--author-from git` to only infer from Git configuration. Use `--author-from none` to avoid inferring the author information.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Fetch the author information from some sources (e.g., Git) automatically
- `git`: Fetch the author information from Git configuration only
- `none`: Do not infer the author information

[`--bare`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--bare)

Possible values:

- `uv`: Use uv as the project build backend
- `hatch`: Use [hatchling](https://pypi.org/project/hatchling) as the project build backend
- `flit`: Use [flit-core](https://pypi.org/project/flit-core) as the project build backend
- `pdm`: Use [pdm-backend](https://pypi.org/project/pdm-backend) as the project build backend
- `poetry`: Use [poetry-core](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-core) as the project build backend
- `setuptools`: Use [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools) as the project build backend
- `maturin`: Use [maturin](https://pypi.org/project/maturin) as the project build backend
- `scikit`: Use [scikit-build-core](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-build-core) as the project build backend

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--description`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--description) _description_

Set the project description

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See `--project` to only change the project root directory.

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--lib`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--lib), `--library`

Create a project for a library.

A library is a project that is intended to be built and distributed as a Python package.

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--name`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--name) _name_

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-config`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-config)

Avoid discovering configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-description`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-description)

Disable the description for the project

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

This is the default behavior when using `--app`.

[`--no-pin-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-pin-python)

Do not create a `.python-version` file for the project.

By default, uv will create a `.python-version` file containing the minor version of the discovered Python interpreter, which will cause subsequent uv commands to use that version.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--no-readme`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-readme)

Do not create a `README.md` file

[`--no-workspace`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--no-workspace), `--no-project`

Avoid discovering a workspace and create a standalone project.

By default, uv searches for workspaces in the current directory or any parent directory.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--package)

Set up the project to be built as a Python package.

Defines a `[build-system]` for the project.

This is the default behavior when using `--lib` or `--build-backend`.

When using `--app`, this will include a `[project.scripts]` entrypoint and use a `src/` project structure.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--python), `-p` _python_

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--script`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--script)

Create a script.

A script is a standalone file with embedded metadata enumerating its dependencies, along with any Python version requirements, as defined in the PEP 723 specification.

PEP 723 scripts can be executed directly with `uv run`.

By default, adds a requirement on the system Python version; use `--python` to specify an alternative Python version requirement.

[`--vcs`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--vcs) _vcs_

Initialize a version control system for the project.

By default, uv will initialize a Git repository (`git`). Use `--vcs none` to explicitly avoid initializing a version control system.

Possible values:

- `git`: Use Git for version control
- `none`: Do not use any version control system

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-init--verbose), `-v`

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

## [uv add](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-add)

Add dependencies to the project.

Dependencies are added to the project's `pyproject.toml` file.

If a given dependency exists already, it will be updated to the new version specifier unless it includes markers that differ from the existing specifier in which case another entry for the dependency will be added.

The lockfile and project environment will be updated to reflect the added dependencies. To skip updating the lockfile, use `--frozen`. To skip updating the environment, use `--no-sync`.

If any of the requested dependencies cannot be found, uv will exit with an error, unless the `--frozen` flag is provided, in which case uv will add the dependencies verbatim without checking that they exist or are compatible with the project.

uv will search for a project in the current directory or any parent directory. If a project cannot be found, uv will exit with an error.

### Usage

```
uv add [OPTIONS] <PACKAGES|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>>
```

### Arguments

[PACKAGES](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--packages)

The packages to add, as PEP 508 requirements (e.g., `ruff==0.5.0`)

### Options

[`--active`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--active)

Prefer the active virtual environment over the project's virtual environment.

If the project virtual environment is active or no virtual environment is active, this has no effect.

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--bounds`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--bounds) _bounds_

The kind of version specifier to use when adding dependencies.

When adding a dependency to the project, if no constraint or URL is provided, a constraint is added based on the latest compatible version of the package. By default, a lower bound constraint is used, e.g., `>=1.2.3`.

When `--frozen` is provided, no resolution is performed, and dependencies are always added without constraints.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

Possible values:

- `lower`: Only a lower bound, e.g., `>=1.2.3`
- `major`: Allow the same major version, similar to the semver caret, e.g., `>=1.2.3, <2.0.0`
- `minor`: Allow the same minor version, similar to the semver tilde, e.g., `>=1.2.3, <1.3.0`
- `exact`: Pin the exact version, e.g., `==1.2.3`

[`--branch`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--branch) _branch_

Branch to use when adding a dependency from Git

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--config-setting`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--config-setting), `--config-settings`, `-C` _config-setting_

Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as `KEY=VALUE` pairs

[`--config-settings-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--config-settings-package), `--config-settings-package` _config-settings-package_

Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend for a specific package, specified as `PACKAGE:KEY=VALUE` pairs

[`--constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--constraints), `--constraint`, `-c` _constraints_

Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. The constraints will _not_ be added to the project's `pyproject.toml` file, but _will_ be respected during dependency resolution.

This is equivalent to pip's `--constraint` option.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--extra) _extra_

Extras to enable for the dependency.

May be provided more than once.

To add this dependency to an optional extra instead, see `--optional`.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--frozen`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--frozen)

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--locked`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--locked)

May also be set with the `UV_LOCKED` environment variable.

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--marker`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--marker), `-m` _marker_

Apply this marker to all added packages

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-binary)

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BINARY` environment variable.

[`--no-binary-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-binary-package) _no-binary-package_

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BINARY_PACKAGE` environment variable.

[`--no-build`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-build)

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD` environment variable.

[`--no-build-isolation`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-build-isolation)

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION` environment variable.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-index)

Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

[`--no-install-local`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-install-local)

Do not install local path dependencies

Skips the current project, workspace members, and any other local (path or editable) packages. Only remote/indexed dependencies are installed. Useful in Docker builds to cache heavy third-party dependencies first and layer local packages separately.

[`--no-install-project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-install-project)

Do not install the current project.

By default, the current project is installed into the environment with all of its dependencies. The `--no-install-project` option allows the project to be excluded, but all of its dependencies are still installed. This is particularly useful in situations like building Docker images where installing the project separately from its dependencies allows optimal layer caching.

[`--no-install-workspace`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-install-workspace)

Do not install any workspace members, including the current project.

By default, all of the workspace members and their dependencies are installed into the environment. The `--no-install-workspace` option allows exclusion of all the workspace members while retaining their dependencies. This is particularly useful in situations like building Docker images where installing the workspace separately from its dependencies allows optimal layer caching.

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--no-sources`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-sources)

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

May also be set with the `UV_NO_SOURCES` environment variable.

[`--no-sync`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-sync)

Avoid syncing the virtual environment

May also be set with the `UV_NO_SYNC` environment variable.

[`--no-workspace`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--no-workspace)

Don't add the dependency as a workspace member.

By default, when adding a dependency that's a local path and is within the workspace directory, uv will add it as a workspace member; pass `--no-workspace` to add the package as direct path dependency instead.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--optional`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--optional) _optional_

Add the requirements to the package's optional dependencies for the specified extra.

The group may then be activated when installing the project with the `--extra` flag.

To enable an optional extra for this requirement instead, see `--extra`.

[`--package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--package) _package_

Add the dependency to a specific package in the workspace

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `if-necessary-or-explicit`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use for resolving and syncing.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the `UV_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--raw`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--raw), `--raw-sources`

Add a dependency as provided.

By default, uv will use the `tool.uv.sources` section to record source information for Git, local, editable, and direct URL requirements. When `--raw` is provided, uv will add source requirements to `project.dependencies`, rather than `tool.uv.sources`.

Additionally, by default, uv will add bounds to your dependency, e.g., `foo>=1.0.0`. When `--raw` is provided, uv will add the dependency without bounds.

[`--refresh`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--refresh)

Refresh all cached data

Possible values:

- `highest`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
- `lowest`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
- `lowest-direct`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

[`--rev`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--rev) _rev_

Commit to use when adding a dependency from Git

[`--script`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--script) _script_

Add the dependency to the specified Python script, rather than to a project.

If provided, uv will add the dependency to the script's inline metadata table, in adherence with PEP 723. If no such inline metadata table is present, a new one will be created and added to the script. When executed via `uv run`, uv will create a temporary environment for the script with all inline dependencies installed.

[`--tag`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--tag) _tag_

Tag to use when adding a dependency from Git

[`--upgrade`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--upgrade), `-U`

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

[`--workspace`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add--workspace)

Add the dependency as a workspace member.

By default, uv will add path dependencies that are within the workspace directory as workspace members. When used with a path dependency, the package will be added to the workspace's `members` list in the root `pyproject.toml` file.

## [uv remove](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-remove)

Remove dependencies from the project.

Dependencies are removed from the project's `pyproject.toml` file.

If multiple entries exist for a given dependency, i.e., each with different markers, all of the entries will be removed.

The lockfile and project environment will be updated to reflect the removed dependencies. To skip updating the lockfile, use `--frozen`. To skip updating the environment, use `--no-sync`.

If any of the requested dependencies are not present in the project, uv will exit with an error.

If a package has been manually installed in the environment, i.e., with `uv pip install`, it will not be removed by `uv remove`.

uv will search for a project in the current directory or any parent directory. If a project cannot be found, uv will exit with an error.

### Usage

```
uv remove [OPTIONS] <PACKAGES>...
```

### Arguments

[PACKAGES](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--packages)

The names of the dependencies to remove (e.g., `ruff`)

### Options

[`--active`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--active)

Prefer the active virtual environment over the project's virtual environment.

If the project virtual environment is active or no virtual environment is active, this has no effect.

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support

- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-remove--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version--no-binary)

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use for resolving and syncing.

[`--resolution`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version--resolution) _resolution_

The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (`highest`).

May also be set with the `UV_RESOLUTION` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `highest`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
- `lowest`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
- `lowest-direct`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

[`--short`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version--short)

Only show the version

By default, uv will show the project name before the version.

[`--upgrade`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-version--upgrade), `-U`

## [uv sync](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-sync)

Update the project's environment.

Syncing ensures that all project dependencies are installed and up-to-date with the lockfile.

By default, an exact sync is performed: uv removes packages that are not declared as dependencies of the project. Use the `--inexact` flag to keep extraneous packages. Note that if an extraneous package conflicts with a project dependency, it will still be removed. Additionally, if `--no-build-isolation` is used, uv will not remove extraneous packages to avoid removing possible build dependencies.

If the project virtual environment (`.venv`) does not exist, it will be created.

The project is re-locked before syncing unless the `--locked` or `--frozen` flag is provided.

uv will search for a project in the current directory or any parent directory. If a project cannot be found, uv will exit with an error.

Note that, when installing from a lockfile, uv will not provide warnings for yanked package versions.

### Usage

```
uv sync [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

[`--active`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--active)

Sync dependencies to the active virtual environment.

Instead of creating or updating the virtual environment for the project or script, the active virtual environment will be preferred, if the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable is set.

[`--all-extras`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--all-extras)

Include all optional dependencies.

When two or more extras are declared as conflicting in `tool.uv.conflicts`, using this flag will always result in an error.

Note that all optional dependencies are always included in the resolution; this option only affects the selection of packages to install.

[`--all-groups`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--all-groups)

Include dependencies from all dependency groups.

`--no-group` can be used to exclude specific groups.

[`--all-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--all-packages)

Sync all packages in the workspace.

The workspace's environment (`.venv`) is updated to include all workspace members.

Any extras or groups specified via `--extra`, `--group`, or related options will be applied to all workspace members.

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--check`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--check)

Check if the Python environment is synchronized with the project.

If the environment is not up to date, uv will exit with an error.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--config-setting`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--config-setting), `--config-settings`, `-C` _config-setting_

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--dry-run`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--dry-run)

Perform a dry run, without writing the lockfile or modifying the project environment.

In dry-run mode, uv will resolve the project's dependencies and report on the resulting changes to both the lockfile and the project environment, but will not modify either.

[`--exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--exclude-newer) _exclude-newer_

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--exclude-newer-package) _exclude-newer-package_

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--extra) _extra_

Include optional dependencies from the specified extra name.

May be provided more than once.

When multiple extras or groups are specified that appear in `tool.uv.conflicts`, uv will report an error.

Note that all optional dependencies are always included in the resolution; this option only affects the selection of packages to install.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--frozen`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--frozen)

Sync without updating the `uv.lock` file.

Instead of checking if the lockfile is up-to-date, uses the versions in the lockfile as the source of truth. If the lockfile is missing, uv will exit with an error. If the `pyproject.toml` includes changes to dependencies that have not been included in the lockfile yet, they will not be present in the environment.

May also be set with the `UV_FROZEN` environment variable.

[`--group`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--group) _group_

Include dependencies from the specified dependency group.

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--inexact`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--inexact), `--no-exact`

Do not remove extraneous packages present in the environment.

When enabled, uv will make the minimum necessary changes to satisfy the requirements. By default, syncing will remove any extraneous packages from the environment

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--locked`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--locked)

Assert that the `uv.lock` will remain unchanged.

Requires that the lockfile is up-to-date. If the lockfile is missing or needs to be updated, uv will exit with an error.

May also be set with the `UV_LOCKED` environment variable.

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-binary)

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

[`--no-default-groups`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-default-groups)

Ignore the default dependency groups.

uv includes the groups defined in `tool.uv.default-groups` by default. This disables that option, however, specific groups can still be included with `--group`.

[`--no-dev`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-dev)

Disable the development dependency group.

This option is an alias of `--no-group dev`. See `--no-default-groups` to disable all default groups instead.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_DEV` environment variable.

May be provided multiple times.

[`--no-group`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-group) _no-group_

Disable the specified dependency group.

This option always takes precedence over default groups, `--all-groups`, and `--group`.

May be provided multiple times.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_GROUP` environment variable.

[`--no-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-index)

Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

[`--no-install-local`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-install-local)

Do not install local path dependencies

Skips the current project, workspace members, and any other local (path or editable) packages. Only remote/indexed dependencies are installed. Useful in Docker builds to cache heavy third-party dependencies first and layer local packages separately.

[`--no-install-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-install-package) _no-install-package_

Do not install the given package(s).

By default, all of the project's dependencies are installed into the environment. The `--no-install-package` option allows exclusion of specific packages. Note this can result in a broken environment, and should be used with caution.

[`--no-install-project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-install-project)

Do not install the current project.

By default, the current project is installed into the environment with all of its dependencies. The `--no-install-project` option allows the project to be excluded, but all of its dependencies are still installed. This is particularly useful in situations like building Docker images where installing the project separately from its dependencies allows optimal layer caching.

[`--no-install-workspace`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-install-workspace)

Do not install any workspace members, including the root project.

By default, all of the workspace members and their dependencies are installed into the environment. The `--no-install-workspace` option allows exclusion of all the workspace members while retaining their dependencies. This is particularly useful in situations like building Docker images where installing the workspace separately from its dependencies allows optimal layer caching.

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--no-sources`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--no-sources)

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

May also be set with the `UV_NO_SOURCES` environment variable.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--only-dev`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--only-dev)

Only include the development dependency group.

The project and its dependencies will be omitted.

This option is an alias for `--only-group dev`. Implies `--no-default-groups`.

[`--only-group`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--only-group) _only-group_

Only include dependencies from the specified dependency group.

The project and its dependencies will be omitted.

May be provided multiple times. Implies `--no-default-groups`.

Select the output format

\[default: text\]

Possible values:

- `text`: Display the result in a human-readable format
- `json`: Display the result in JSON format

[`--package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--package) _package_

Sync for specific packages in the workspace.

The workspace's environment (`.venv`) is updated to reflect the subset of dependencies declared by the specified workspace member packages.

If any workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `if-necessary-or-explicit`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use for the project environment.

By default, the first interpreter that meets the project's `requires-python` constraint is
used.

If a Python interpreter in a virtual environment is provided, the packages will not be
synced to the given environment. The interpreter will be used to create a virtual
environment in the project.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the `UV_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync--python-platform) _python-platform_

The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the _target_ platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the _current_ platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the _target_ platform, as they will be built for the _current_ platform. The `--python-platform` option is intended for advanced use cases.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

## [uv lock](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-lock)

Update the project's lockfile.

If the project lockfile (`uv.lock`) does not exist, it will be created. If a lockfile is present, its contents will be used as preferences for the resolution.

If there are no changes to the project's dependencies, locking will have no effect unless the `--upgrade` flag is provided.

### Usage

```
uv lock [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--dry-run`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--dry-run)

Perform a dry run, without writing the lockfile.

In dry-run mode, uv will resolve the project's dependencies and report on the resulting changes, but will not write the lockfile to disk.

[`--exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--exclude-newer) _exclude-newer_

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--help), `-h`

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used when building source distributions.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--no-binary)

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Possible values:

- `highest`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
- `lowest`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
- `lowest-direct`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

[`--script`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-lock--script) _script_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used when building source distributions.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

May also be set with the `UV_LOCKED` environment variable.

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-annotate`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--no-annotate)

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-export--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use during resolution.

A Python interpreter is required for building source distributions to determine package
metadata when there are not wheels.

The interpreter is also used as the fallback value for the minimum Python version if
`requires-python` is not set.

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tree--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tree--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used when building source distributions.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tree--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tree--no-binary)

Additional arguments can be passed to Ruff after `--`.

### Usage

```
uv format [OPTIONS] [-- <EXTRA_ARGS>...]
```

### Arguments

[EXTRA\_ARGS](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--extra_args)

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--no-project)

Avoid discovering a project or workspace.

Instead of running the formatter in the context of the current project, run it in the context of the current directory. This is useful when the current directory is not a project.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--offline)

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--verbose), `-v`

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

[`--version`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-format--version) _version_

### [uv tool run](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-tool-run)

Run a command provided by a Python package.

By default, the package to install is assumed to match the command name.

The name of the command can include an exact version in the format `<package>@<version>`, e.g., `uv tool run ruff@0.3.0`. If more complex version specification is desired or if the command is provided by a different package, use `--from`.

`uvx` can be used to invoke Python, e.g., with `uvx python` or `uvx python@<version>`. A Python interpreter will be started in an isolated virtual environment.

If the tool was previously installed, i.e., via `uv tool install`, the installed version will be used unless a version is requested or the `--isolated` flag is used.

`uvx` is provided as a convenient alias for `uv tool run`, their behavior is identical.

If no command is provided, the installed tools are displayed.

Packages are installed into an ephemeral virtual environment in the uv cache directory.

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--build-constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--build-constraints), `--build-constraint`, `-b` _build-constraints_

Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building source distributions.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

May also be set with the `UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--config-file) _config-file_

[`--constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--constraints), `--constraint`, `-c` _constraints_

Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's `--constraint` option.

May also be set with the `UV_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--default-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--default-index) _default-index_

The URL of the default package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--directory) _directory_

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--from`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--from) _from_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--no-binary)

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BINARY` environment variable.

[`--no-binary-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--no-binary-package) _no-binary-package_

Don't install pre-built wheels for a specific package

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BINARY_PACKAGE` environment variable.

[`--no-build`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--no-build)

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD` environment variable.

[`--no-build-isolation`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--no-build-isolation)

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

[`--overrides`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--overrides), `--override` _overrides_

Override versions using the given requirements files.

Overrides files are `requirements.txt`-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are _additive_, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent packages, overrides are _absolute_, in that they completely replace the requirements of the constituent packages.

May also be set with the `UV_OVERRIDE` environment variable.

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `if-necessary-or-explicit`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use to build the run environment.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

[`--python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-run--python-platform) _python-platform_

The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the _target_ platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the _current_ platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the _target_ platform, as they will be built for the _current_ platform. The `--python-platform` option is intended for advanced use cases.

The following formats are supported: `requirements.txt`, `.py` files with inline metadata, and `pylock.toml`.

### [uv tool install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-tool-install)

Install commands provided by a Python package.

Packages are installed into an isolated virtual environment in the uv tools directory. The executables are linked the tool executable directory, which is determined according to the XDG standard and can be retrieved with `uv tool dir --bin`.

If the tool was previously installed, the existing tool will generally be replaced.

### Usage

```
uv tool install [OPTIONS] <PACKAGE>
```

### Arguments

[PACKAGE](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--package)

The package to install commands from

### Options

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--build-constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--build-constraints), `--build-constraint`, `-b` _build-constraints_

Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building source distributions.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

May also be set with the `UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--config-setting`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--config-setting), `--config-settings`, `-C` _config-setting_

Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend for a specific package, specified as `PACKAGE:KEY=VALUE` pairs

[`--constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--constraints), `--constraint`, `-c` _constraints_

Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's `--constraint` option.

May also be set with the `UV_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--default-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--default-index) _default-index_

The URL of the default package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--directory) _directory_

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--exclude-newer-package) _exclude-newer-package_

Limit candidate packages for specific packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--excludes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--excludes), `--exclude` _excludes_

Exclude packages from resolution using the given requirements files.

Excludes files are `requirements.txt`-like files that specify packages to exclude from the resolution. When a package is excluded, it will be omitted from the dependency list entirely and its own dependencies will be ignored during the resolution phase. Excludes are unconditional in that requirement specifiers and markers are ignored; any package listed in the provided file will be omitted from all resolved environments.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE` environment variable.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--force`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--force)

Force installation of the tool.

Will replace any existing entry points with the same name in the executable directory.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--no-binary)

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BINARY` environment variable.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD` environment variable.

[`--no-build-isolation`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--no-build-isolation)

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION` environment variable.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_SOURCES` environment variable.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--overrides`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--overrides), `--override` _overrides_

Override versions using the given requirements files.

Overrides files are `requirements.txt`-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are _additive_, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent packages, overrides are _absolute_, in that they completely replace the requirements of the constituent packages.

May also be set with the `UV_OVERRIDE` environment variable.

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use to build the tool environment.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

[`--python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-install--python-platform) _python-platform_

The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the _target_ platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the _current_ platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the _target_ platform, as they will be built for the _current_ platform. The `--python-platform` option is intended for advanced use cases.

### [uv tool upgrade](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-tool-upgrade)

Upgrade installed tools.

If a tool was installed with version constraints, they will be respected on upgrade — to upgrade a tool beyond the originally provided constraints, use `uv tool install` again.

If a tool was installed with specific settings, they will be respected on upgraded. For example, if `--prereleases allow` was provided during installation, it will continue to be respected in upgrades.

### Usage

```
uv tool upgrade [OPTIONS] <NAME>...
```

### Arguments

[NAME](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--name)

The name of the tool to upgrade, along with an optional version specifier

### Options

[`--all`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--all)

Upgrade all tools

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--config-setting`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--config-setting), `--config-settings`, `-C` _config-setting_

[`--default-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--default-index) _default-index_

The URL of the default package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--no-binary)

Don't install pre-built wheels.

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `if-necessary-or-explicit`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-tool-upgrade--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the _target_ platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the _current_ platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the _target_ platform, as they will be built for the _current_ platform. The `--python-platform` option is intended for advanced use cases.

## [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-python)

Manage Python versions and installations

Generally, uv first searches for Python in a virtual environment, either active or in a
`.venv` directory in the current working directory or any parent directory. If a virtual
environment is not required, uv will then search for a Python interpreter. Python
interpreters are found by searching for Python executables in the `PATH` environment
variable.

On Windows, the registry is also searched for Python executables.

By default, uv will download Python if a version cannot be found. This behavior can be
disabled with the `--no-python-downloads` flag or the `python-downloads` setting.

The `--python` option allows requesting a different interpreter.

The following Python version request formats are supported:

- `<version>` e.g. `3`, `3.12`, `3.12.3`
- `<version-specifier>` e.g. `>=3.12,<3.13`
- `<version><short-variant>` (e.g., `3.13t`, `3.12.0d`)
- `<version>+<variant>` (e.g., `3.13+freethreaded`, `3.12.0+debug`)
- `<implementation>` e.g. `cpython` or `cp`
- `<implementation>@<version>` e.g. `cpython@3.12`
- `<implementation><version>` e.g. `cpython3.12` or `cp312`
- `<implementation><version-specifier>` e.g. `cpython>=3.12,<3.13`
- `<implementation>-<version>-<os>-<arch>-<libc>` e.g. `cpython-3.12.3-macos-aarch64-none`

Additionally, a specific system Python interpreter can often be requested with:

- `<executable-path>` e.g. `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`
- `<executable-name>` e.g. `mypython3`
- `<install-dir>` e.g. `/some/environment/`

When the `--python` option is used, normal discovery rules apply but discovered interpreters
are checked for compatibility with the request, e.g., if `pypy` is requested, uv will first
check if the virtual environment contains a PyPy interpreter then check if each executable
in the path is a PyPy interpreter.

uv supports discovering CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy interpreters. Unsupported interpreters
will be skipped during discovery. If an unsupported interpreter implementation is requested,
uv will exit with an error.

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-config`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--no-config)

Avoid discovering configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--no-project), `--no-workspace`

Avoid validating the Python pin is compatible with the project or workspace.

By default, a project or workspace is discovered in the current directory or any parent directory. If a workspace is found, the Python pin is validated against the workspace's `requires-python` constraint.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--resolved`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--resolved)

Write the resolved Python interpreter path instead of the request.

Ensures that the exact same interpreter is used.

This option is usually not safe to use when committing the `.python-version` file to version control.

[`--rm`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--rm)

Remove the Python version pin

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python-pin--verbose), `-v`

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

### [uv python dir](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-python-dir)

Show the uv Python installation directory.

By default, Python installations are stored in the uv data directory at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/uv/python` or `$HOME/.local/share/uv/python` on Unix and `%APPDATA%\uv\data\python` on Windows.

The Python installation directory may be overridden with `$UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR`.

- `line`: Render the annotations on a single, comma-separated line
- `split`: Render each annotation on its own line

[`--build-constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--build-constraints), `--build-constraint`, `-b` _build-constraints_

Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building source distributions.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

May also be set with the `UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

[`--constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--constraints), `--constraint`, `-c` _constraints_

Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's `--constraint` option.

May also be set with the `UV_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--custom-compile-command`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--custom-compile-command) _custom-compile-command_

The header comment to include at the top of the output file generated by `uv pip compile`.

Used to reflect custom build scripts and commands that wrap `uv pip compile`.

May also be set with the `UV_CUSTOM_COMPILE_COMMAND` environment variable.

[`--default-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--default-index) _default-index_

The URL of the default package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--excludes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--excludes), `--exclude` _excludes_

Exclude packages from resolution using the given requirements files.

Excludes files are `requirements.txt`-like files that specify packages to exclude from the resolution. When a package is excluded, it will be omitted from the dependency list entirely and its own dependencies will be ignored during the resolution phase. Excludes are unconditional in that requirement specifiers and markers are ignored; any package listed in the provided file will be omitted from all resolved environments.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE` environment variable.

[`--extra`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--extra) _extra_

Include optional dependencies from the specified extra name; may be provided more than once.

Only applies to `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` sources.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--format`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--format) _format_

The format in which the resolution should be output.

Supports both `requirements.txt` and `pylock.toml` (PEP 751) output formats.

uv will infer the output format from the file extension of the output file, if provided. Otherwise, defaults to `requirements.txt`.

Possible values:

- `requirements.txt`: Export in `requirements.txt` format
- `pylock.toml`: Export in `pylock.toml` format

[`--generate-hashes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--generate-hashes)

Include distribution hashes in the output file

[`--group`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--group) _group_

Install the specified dependency group from a `pyproject.toml`.

If no path is provided, the `pyproject.toml` in the working directory is used.

May be provided multiple times.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used when building source distributions.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-annotate`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-annotate)

Exclude comment annotations indicating the source of each package

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-binary) _no-binary_

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`. Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

[`--no-build`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-build)

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for `--only-binary :all:`.

[`--no-build-isolation`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-build-isolation)

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION` environment variable.

Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-deps`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-deps)

Ignore package dependencies, instead only add those packages explicitly listed on the command line to the resulting requirements file

[`--no-emit-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-emit-package), `--unsafe-package` _no-emit-package_

Specify a package to omit from the output resolution. Its dependencies will still be included in the resolution. Equivalent to pip-compile's `--unsafe-package` option

[`--no-header`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-header)

Exclude the comment header at the top of the generated output file

[`--no-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-index)

Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--no-sources`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-sources)

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

May also be set with the `UV_NO_SOURCES` environment variable.

[`--no-strip-extras`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-strip-extras)

Include extras in the output file.

By default, uv strips extras, as any packages pulled in by the extras are already included as dependencies in the output file directly. Further, output files generated with `--no-strip-extras` cannot be used as constraints files in `install` and `sync` invocations.

[`--no-strip-markers`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--no-strip-markers)

Include environment markers in the output file.

By default, uv strips environment markers, as the resolution generated by `compile` is only guaranteed to be correct for the target environment.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--only-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--only-binary) _only-binary_

Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`. Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

[`--output-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--output-file), `-o` _output-file_

Write the compiled requirements to the given `requirements.txt` or `pylock.toml` file.

If the file already exists, the existing versions will be preferred when resolving dependencies, unless `--upgrade` is also specified.

[`--overrides`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--overrides), `--override` _overrides_

Override versions using the given requirements files.

Overrides files are `requirements.txt`-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are _additive_, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent packages, overrides are _absolute_, in that they completely replace the requirements of the constituent packages.

May also be set with the `UV_OVERRIDE` environment variable.

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `if-necessary-or-explicit`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use during resolution.

A Python interpreter is required for building source distributions to determine package
metadata when there are not wheels.

The interpreter is also used to determine the default minimum Python version, unless
`--python-version` is provided.

This option respects `UV_PYTHON`, but when set via environment variable, it is overridden
by `--python-version`.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

[`--python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--python-platform) _python-platform_

The platform for which requirements should be resolved.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

Possible values:

- `windows`: An alias for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, the default target for Windows
- `linux`: An alias for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, the default target for Linux

- `x86_64-apple-ios-simulator`: An `x86_64` target for iOS simulator

[`--python-version`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--python-version) _python-version_

The Python version to use for resolution.

For example, `3.8` or `3.8.17`.

Defaults to the version of the Python interpreter used for resolution.

Defines the minimum Python version that must be supported by the resolved requirements.

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, `3.8` is mapped to `3.8.0`.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--refresh`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--refresh)

Refresh all cached data

[`--refresh-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--refresh-package) _refresh-package_

Refresh cached data for a specific package

[`--resolution`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--resolution) _resolution_

The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (`highest`).

May also be set with the `UV_RESOLUTION` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `highest`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
- `lowest`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
- `lowest-direct`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

[`--system`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--system)

Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv uses the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent directory, falling back to searching for a Python executable in `PATH`. The `--system` option instructs uv to avoid using a virtual environment Python and restrict its search to the system path.

May also be set with the `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--torch-backend`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--torch-backend) _torch-backend_

The backend to use when fetching packages in the PyTorch ecosystem (e.g., `cpu`, `cu126`, or `auto`).

When set, uv will ignore the configured index URLs for packages in the PyTorch ecosystem, and will instead use the defined backend.

For example, when set to `cpu`, uv will use the CPU-only PyTorch index; when set to `cu126`, uv will use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6.

The `auto` mode will attempt to detect the appropriate PyTorch index based on the currently installed CUDA drivers.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

May also be set with the `UV_TORCH_BACKEND` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Select the appropriate PyTorch index based on the operating system and CUDA driver version

[`--universal`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--universal)

Perform a universal resolution, attempting to generate a single `requirements.txt` output file that is compatible with all operating systems, architectures, and Python implementations.

In universal mode, the current Python version (or user-provided `--python-version`) will be treated as a lower bound. For example, `--universal --python-version 3.7` would produce a universal resolution for Python 3.7 and later.

Implies `--no-strip-markers`.

[`--upgrade`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--upgrade), `-U`

Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies `--refresh`

[`--upgrade-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--upgrade-package), `-P` _upgrade-package_

Allow upgrades for a specific package, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies `--refresh-package`

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-compile--verbose), `-v`

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

### [uv pip sync](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-pip-sync)

Sync an environment with a `requirements.txt` or `pylock.toml` file.

When syncing an environment, any packages not listed in the `requirements.txt` or `pylock.toml` file will be removed. To retain extraneous packages, use `uv pip install` instead.

The input file is presumed to be the output of a `pip compile` or `uv export` operation, in which it will include all transitive dependencies. If transitive dependencies are not present in the file, they will not be installed. Use `--strict` to warn if any transitive dependencies are missing.

### Usage

```
uv pip sync [OPTIONS] <SRC_FILE>...
```

### Arguments

[SRC\_FILE](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--src_file)

Include the packages listed in the given files.

The following formats are supported: `requirements.txt`, `.py` files with inline metadata, `pylock.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg`.

If a `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg` file is provided, uv will extract the requirements for the relevant project.

If `-` is provided, then requirements will be read from stdin.

### Options

[`--all-extras`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--all-extras)

Include all optional dependencies.

Only applies to `pylock.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` sources.

[`--allow-empty-requirements`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--allow-empty-requirements)

Allow sync of empty requirements, which will clear the environment of all packages

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--break-system-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--break-system-packages)

Allow uv to modify an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` Python installation.

WARNING: `--break-system-packages` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external package manager, like `apt`. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or `pip`).

May also be set with the `UV_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` environment variable.

[`--build-constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--build-constraints), `--build-constraint`, `-b` _build-constraints_

Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building source distributions.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

May also be set with the `UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--config-setting`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--config-setting), `--config-settings`, `-C` _config-setting_

Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as `KEY=VALUE` pairs

[`--config-settings-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--config-settings-package), `--config-settings-package` _config-settings-package_

Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend for a specific package, specified as `PACKAGE:KEY=VALUE` pairs

[`--constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--constraints), `--constraint`, `-c` _constraints_

Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's `--constraint` option.

May also be set with the `UV_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--default-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--default-index) _default-index_

The URL of the default package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See `--project` to only change the project root directory.

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--dry-run`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--dry-run)

[`--exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--exclude-newer) _exclude-newer_

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--exclude-newer-package) _exclude-newer-package_

Limit candidate packages for specific packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--extra) _extra_

Include optional dependencies from the specified extra name; may be provided more than once.

Only applies to `pylock.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` sources.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--group`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--group) _group_

Install the specified dependency group from a `pylock.toml` or `pyproject.toml`.

If no path is provided, the `pylock.toml` or `pyproject.toml` in the working directory is used.

May be provided multiple times.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-allow-empty-requirements`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-allow-empty-requirements)[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-binary) _no-binary_

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`. Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

[`--no-break-system-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-break-system-packages)[`--no-build`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-build)

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for `--only-binary :all:`.

[`--no-build-isolation`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-build-isolation)

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION` environment variable.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-index)

Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--no-sources`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-sources)

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

May also be set with the `UV_NO_SOURCES` environment variable.

[`--no-verify-hashes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--no-verify-hashes)

Disable validation of hashes in the requirements file.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash. To enforce hash validation, use `--require-hashes`.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_VERIFY_HASHES` environment variable.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--only-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--only-binary) _only-binary_

Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`. Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

[`--prefix`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--prefix) _prefix_

Install packages into `lib`, `bin`, and other top-level folders under the specified directory, as if a virtual environment were present at that location.

In general, prefer the use of `--python` to install into an alternate environment, as scripts and other artifacts installed via `--prefix` will reference the installing interpreter, rather than any interpreter added to the `--prefix` directory, rendering them non-portable.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter into which packages should be installed.

By default, syncing requires a virtual environment. A path to an alternative Python can be
provided, but it is only recommended in continuous integration (CI) environments and should
be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the `UV_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--python-platform) _python-platform_

The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the _target_ platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the _current_ platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the _target_ platform, as they will be built for the _current_ platform. The `--python-platform` option is intended for advanced use cases.

[`--python-version`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--python-version) _python-version_

The minimum Python version that should be supported by the requirements (e.g., `3.7` or `3.7.9`).

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, `3.7` is mapped to `3.7.0`.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--refresh`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--refresh)

Refresh all cached data

[`--refresh-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--refresh-package) _refresh-package_

Refresh cached data for a specific package

[`--reinstall`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--reinstall), `--force-reinstall`

Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies `--refresh`

[`--reinstall-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--reinstall-package) _reinstall-package_

Reinstall a specific package, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies `--refresh-package`

[`--require-hashes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--require-hashes)

Require a matching hash for each requirement.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash.

When `--require-hashes` is enabled, _all_ requirements must include a hash or set of hashes, and _all_ requirements must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., `==1.0.0`), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

- Git dependencies are not supported. - Editable installations are not supported. - Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (`.whl`) or source archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`), as opposed to a directory.

May also be set with the `UV_REQUIRE_HASHES` environment variable.

[`--strict`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--strict)

Validate the Python environment after completing the installation, to detect packages with missing dependencies or other issues

[`--system`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--system)

Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent directory. The `--system` option instructs uv to instead use the first Python found in the system `PATH`.

WARNING: `--system` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

May also be set with the `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--target`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--target) _target_

Install packages into the specified directory, rather than into the virtual or system Python environment. The packages will be installed at the top-level of the directory

[`--torch-backend`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-sync--torch-backend) _torch-backend_

The backend to use when fetching packages in the PyTorch ecosystem (e.g., `cpu`, `cu126`, or `auto`).

When set, uv will ignore the configured index URLs for packages in the PyTorch ecosystem, and will instead use the defined backend.

For example, when set to `cpu`, uv will use the CPU-only PyTorch index; when set to `cu126`, uv will use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6.

The `auto` mode will attempt to detect the appropriate PyTorch index based on the currently installed CUDA drivers.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

May also be set with the `UV_TORCH_BACKEND` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Select the appropriate PyTorch index based on the operating system and CUDA driver version
- `cpu`: Use the CPU-only PyTorch index
- `cu130`: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 13.0
- `cu129`: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.9

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

### [uv pip install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-pip-install)

Install packages into an environment

### Usage

```
uv pip install [OPTIONS] <PACKAGE|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>|--editable <EDITABLE>|--group <GROUP>>
```

### Arguments

[PACKAGE](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--package)

Install all listed packages.

The order of the packages is used to determine priority during resolution.

### Options

[`--all-extras`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--all-extras)

Include all optional dependencies.

Only applies to `pylock.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` sources.

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--break-system-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--break-system-packages)

Allow uv to modify an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` Python installation.

WARNING: `--break-system-packages` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external package manager, like `apt`. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or `pip`).

May also be set with the `UV_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` environment variable.

[`--build-constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--build-constraints), `--build-constraint`, `-b` _build-constraints_

Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building source distributions.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

May also be set with the `UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--compile-bytecode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--compile-bytecode), `--compile`

Compile Python files to bytecode after installation.

By default, uv does not compile Python (`.py`) files to bytecode (`__pycache__/*.pyc`); instead, compilation is performed lazily the first time a module is imported. For use-cases in which start time is critical, such as CLI applications and Docker containers, this option can be enabled to trade longer installation times for faster start times.

When enabled, uv will process the entire site-packages directory (including packages that are not being modified by the current operation) for consistency. Like pip, it will also ignore errors.

May also be set with the `UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE` environment variable.

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--config-setting`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--config-setting), `--config-settings`, `-C` _config-setting_

Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend, specified as `KEY=VALUE` pairs

[`--config-settings-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--config-settings-package), `--config-settings-package` _config-settings-package_

Settings to pass to the PEP 517 build backend for a specific package, specified as `PACKAGE:KEY=VALUE` pairs

[`--constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--constraints), `--constraint`, `-c` _constraints_

Constrain versions using the given requirements files.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a requirement that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the installation of that package.

This is equivalent to pip's `--constraint` option.

May also be set with the `UV_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--default-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--default-index) _default-index_

The URL of the default package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See `--project` to only change the project root directory.

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--dry-run`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--dry-run)

Perform a dry run, i.e., don't actually install anything but resolve the dependencies and print the resulting plan

[`--editable`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--editable), `-e` _editable_

Install the editable package based on the provided local file path

[`--exact`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--exact)

Perform an exact sync, removing extraneous packages.

By default, installing will make the minimum necessary changes to satisfy the requirements. When enabled, uv will update the environment to exactly match the requirements, removing packages that are not included in the requirements.

[`--exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--exclude-newer) _exclude-newer_

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--exclude-newer-package) _exclude-newer-package_

Limit candidate packages for specific packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--excludes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--excludes), `--exclude` _excludes_

Exclude packages from resolution using the given requirements files.

Excludes files are `requirements.txt`-like files that specify packages to exclude from the resolution. When a package is excluded, it will be omitted from the dependency list entirely and its own dependencies will be ignored during the resolution phase. Excludes are unconditional in that requirement specifiers and markers are ignored; any package listed in the provided file will be omitted from all resolved environments.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE` environment variable.

[`--extra`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--extra) _extra_

Include optional dependencies from the specified extra name; may be provided more than once.

Only applies to `pylock.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg` sources.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--group`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--group) _group_

Install the specified dependency group from a `pylock.toml` or `pyproject.toml`.

If no path is provided, the `pylock.toml` or `pyproject.toml` in the working directory is used.

May be provided multiple times.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-binary) _no-binary_

Don't install pre-built wheels.

The given packages will be built and installed from source. The resolver will still use pre-built wheels to extract package metadata, if available.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`. Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

[`--no-break-system-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-break-system-packages)[`--no-build`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-build)

Don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run arbitrary Python code. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Alias for `--only-binary :all:`.

[`--no-build-isolation`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-build-isolation)

Disable isolation when building source distributions.

Assumes that build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION` environment variable.

[`--no-build-isolation-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-build-isolation-package) _no-build-isolation-package_

Disable isolation when building source distributions for a specific package.

Assumes that the packages' build dependencies specified by PEP 518 are already installed.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-config`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-config)

Avoid discovering configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-deps`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-deps)

Ignore package dependencies, instead only installing those packages explicitly listed on the command line or in the requirements files

[`--no-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-index)

Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--no-sources`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-sources)

Ignore the `tool.uv.sources` table when resolving dependencies. Used to lock against the standards-compliant, publishable package metadata, as opposed to using any workspace, Git, URL, or local path sources

May also be set with the `UV_NO_SOURCES` environment variable.

[`--no-verify-hashes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--no-verify-hashes)

Disable validation of hashes in the requirements file.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash. To enforce hash validation, use `--require-hashes`.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_VERIFY_HASHES` environment variable.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--only-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--only-binary) _only-binary_

Only use pre-built wheels; don't build source distributions.

When enabled, resolving will not run code from the given packages. The cached wheels of already-built source distributions will be reused, but operations that require building distributions will exit with an error.

Multiple packages may be provided. Disable binaries for all packages with `:all:`. Clear previously specified packages with `:none:`.

[`--overrides`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--overrides), `--override` _overrides_

Override versions using the given requirements files.

Overrides files are `requirements.txt`-like files that force a specific version of a requirement to be installed, regardless of the requirements declared by any constituent package, and regardless of whether this would be considered an invalid resolution.

While constraints are _additive_, in that they're combined with the requirements of the constituent packages, overrides are _absolute_, in that they completely replace the requirements of the constituent packages.

May also be set with the `UV_OVERRIDE` environment variable.

[`--prefix`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--prefix) _prefix_

Install packages into `lib`, `bin`, and other top-level folders under the specified directory, as if a virtual environment were present at that location.

In general, prefer the use of `--python` to install into an alternate environment, as scripts and other artifacts installed via `--prefix` will reference the installing interpreter, rather than any interpreter added to the `--prefix` directory, rendering them non-portable.

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions
- `if-necessary`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release
- `explicit`: Allow pre-release versions for first-party packages with explicit pre-release markers in their version requirements
- `if-necessary-or-explicit`: Allow pre-release versions if all versions of a package are pre-release, or if the package has an explicit pre-release marker in its version requirements

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter into which packages should be installed.

By default, installation requires a virtual environment. A path to an alternative Python can
be provided, but it is only recommended in continuous integration (CI) environments and
should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the `UV_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--python-platform`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--python-platform) _python-platform_

The platform for which requirements should be installed.

Represented as a "target triple", a string that describes the target platform in terms of its CPU, vendor, and operating system name, like `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.

When targeting macOS (Darwin), the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting iOS, the default minimum version is `13.0`. Use `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `14.0`.

When targeting Android, the default minimum Android API level is `24`. Use `ANDROID_API_LEVEL` to specify a different minimum version, e.g., `26`.

WARNING: When specified, uv will select wheels that are compatible with the _target_ platform; as a result, the installed distributions may not be compatible with the _current_ platform. Conversely, any distributions that are built from source may be incompatible with the _target_ platform, as they will be built for the _current_ platform. The `--python-platform` option is intended for advanced use cases.

The minimum Python version that should be supported by the requirements (e.g., `3.7` or `3.7.9`).

If a patch version is omitted, the minimum patch version is assumed. For example, `3.7` is mapped to `3.7.0`.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--refresh`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--refresh)

Refresh all cached data

[`--refresh-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--refresh-package) _refresh-package_

Refresh cached data for a specific package

[`--reinstall`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--reinstall), `--force-reinstall`

Reinstall all packages, regardless of whether they're already installed. Implies `--refresh`

[`--reinstall-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--reinstall-package) _reinstall-package_

Reinstall a specific package, regardless of whether it's already installed. Implies `--refresh-package`

[`--require-hashes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--require-hashes)

Require a matching hash for each requirement.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash.

When `--require-hashes` is enabled, _all_ requirements must include a hash or set of hashes, and _all_ requirements must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., `==1.0.0`), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

- Git dependencies are not supported. - Editable installations are not supported. - Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (`.whl`) or source archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`), as opposed to a directory.

May also be set with the `UV_REQUIRE_HASHES` environment variable.

[`--requirements`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--requirements), `--requirement`, `-r` _requirements_

Install the packages listed in the given files.

The following formats are supported: `requirements.txt`, `.py` files with inline metadata, `pylock.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and `setup.cfg`.

If a `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or `setup.cfg` file is provided, uv will extract the requirements for the relevant project.

If `-` is provided, then requirements will be read from stdin.

[`--resolution`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--resolution) _resolution_

The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

By default, uv will use the latest compatible version of each package (`highest`).

May also be set with the `UV_RESOLUTION` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `highest`: Resolve the highest compatible version of each package
- `lowest`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of each package
- `lowest-direct`: Resolve the lowest compatible version of any direct dependencies, and the highest compatible version of any transitive dependencies

[`--strict`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--strict)

Validate the Python environment after completing the installation, to detect packages with missing dependencies or other issues

[`--system`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--system)

Install packages into the system Python environment.

By default, uv installs into the virtual environment in the current working directory or any parent directory. The `--system` option instructs uv to instead use the first Python found in the system `PATH`.

WARNING: `--system` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments and should be used with caution, as it can modify the system Python installation.

May also be set with the `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--target`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--target) _target_

Install packages into the specified directory, rather than into the virtual or system Python environment. The packages will be installed at the top-level of the directory

[`--torch-backend`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-install--torch-backend) _torch-backend_

The backend to use when fetching packages in the PyTorch ecosystem (e.g., `cpu`, `cu126`, or `auto`)

When set, uv will ignore the configured index URLs for packages in the PyTorch ecosystem, and will instead use the defined backend.

For example, when set to `cpu`, uv will use the CPU-only PyTorch index; when set to `cu126`, uv will use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.6.

The `auto` mode will attempt to detect the appropriate PyTorch index based on the currently installed CUDA drivers.

This option is in preview and may change in any future release.

May also be set with the `UV_TORCH_BACKEND` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Select the appropriate PyTorch index based on the operating system and CUDA driver version
- `cpu`: Use the CPU-only PyTorch index
- `cu130`: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 13.0
- `cu129`: Use the PyTorch index for CUDA 12.9

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

### [uv pip uninstall](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-pip-uninstall)

Uninstall packages from an environment

### Usage

```
uv pip uninstall [OPTIONS] <PACKAGE|--requirements <REQUIREMENTS>>
```

### Arguments

[PACKAGE](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--package)

Uninstall all listed packages

### Options

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--break-system-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--break-system-packages)

Allow uv to modify an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` Python installation.

WARNING: `--break-system-packages` is intended for use in continuous integration (CI) environments, when installing into Python installations that are managed by an external package manager, like `apt`. It should be used with caution, as such Python installations explicitly recommend against modifications by other package managers (like uv or `pip`).

May also be set with the `UV_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See `--project` to only change the project root directory.

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--dry-run`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--dry-run)

Perform a dry run, i.e., don't actually uninstall anything but print the resulting plan

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--help), `-h`

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for remote requirements files.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-uninstall--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

[`--python-version`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-check--python-version) _python-version_

The Python version against which packages should be checked.

By default, the installed packages are checked against the version of the current interpreter.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-check--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--system`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-check--system)

Check packages in the system Python environment.

Disables discovery of virtual environments.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery.

May also be set with the `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-pip-check--verbose), `-v`

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

## [uv venv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-venv)

Create a virtual environment.

By default, creates a virtual environment named `.venv` in the working directory. An alternative path may be provided positionally.

If in a project, the default environment name can be changed with the `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable; this only applies when run from the project root directory.

If a virtual environment exists at the target path, it will be removed and a new, empty virtual environment will be created.

When using uv, the virtual environment does not need to be activated. uv will find a virtual environment (named `.venv`) in the working directory or any parent directories.

### Usage

```
uv venv [OPTIONS] [PATH]
```

### Arguments

[PATH](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--path)

The path to the virtual environment to create.

Default to `.venv` in the working directory.

Relative paths are resolved relative to the working directory.

### Options

[`--allow-existing`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--allow-existing)

Preserve any existing files or directories at the target path.

By default, `uv venv` will exit with an error if the given path is non-empty. The `--allow-existing` option will instead write to the given path, regardless of its contents, and without clearing it beforehand.

WARNING: This option can lead to unexpected behavior if the existing virtual environment and the newly-created virtual environment are linked to different Python interpreters.

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--clear`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--clear), `-c`

Remove any existing files or directories at the target path.

By default, `uv venv` will exit with an error if the given path is non-empty. The `--clear` option will instead clear a non-empty path before creating a new virtual environment.

May also be set with the `UV_VENV_CLEAR` environment variable.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--default-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--default-index) _default-index_

The URL of the default package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--index` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

Relative paths are resolved with the given directory as the base.

See `--project` to only change the project root directory.

May also be set with the `UV_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--exclude-newer) _exclude-newer_

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--exclude-newer-package) _exclude-newer-package_

Limit candidate packages for a specific package to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used for installing seed packages.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

Avoid reading from or writing to the cache, instead using a temporary directory for the duration of the operation

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CACHE` environment variable.

[`--no-config`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--no-config)

Avoid discovering configuration files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`).

Normally, configuration files are discovered in the current directory, parent directories, or user configuration directories.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--no-index)

Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--no-progress)

Hide all progress outputs.

For example, spinners or progress bars.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_PROGRESS` environment variable.

[`--no-project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--no-project), `--no-workspace`

Avoid discovering a project or workspace.

By default, uv searches for projects in the current directory or any parent directory to determine the default path of the virtual environment and check for Python version constraints, if any.

[`--no-python-downloads`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--no-python-downloads)

Disable automatic downloads of Python.

[`--offline`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--offline)

Disable network access.

When disabled, uv will only use locally cached data and locally available files.

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--prompt`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--prompt) _prompt_

Provide an alternative prompt prefix for the virtual environment.

By default, the prompt is dependent on whether a path was provided to `uv venv`. If provided
(e.g, `uv venv project`), the prompt is set to the directory name. If not provided
(`uv venv`), the prompt is set to the current directory's name.

If "." is provided, the current directory name will be used regardless of whether a path was
provided to `uv venv`.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use for the virtual environment.

During virtual environment creation, uv will not look for Python interpreters in virtual
environments.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) for details on Python discovery and supported request formats.

May also be set with the `UV_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--quiet), `-q`

Use quiet output.

Repeating this option, e.g., `-qq`, will enable a silent mode in which uv will write no output to stdout.

[`--refresh`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--refresh)

Refresh all cached data

[`--refresh-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--refresh-package) _refresh-package_

Refresh cached data for a specific package

[`--relocatable`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--relocatable)

Make the virtual environment relocatable.

A relocatable virtual environment can be moved around and redistributed without invalidating its associated entrypoint and activation scripts.

Note that this can only be guaranteed for standard `console_scripts` and `gui_scripts`. Other scripts may be adjusted if they ship with a generic `#!python[w]` shebang, and binaries are left as-is.

As a result of making the environment relocatable (by way of writing relative, rather than absolute paths), the entrypoints and scripts themselves will _not_ be relocatable. In other words, copying those entrypoints and scripts to a location outside the environment will not work, as they reference paths relative to the environment itself.

[`--seed`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--seed)

Install seed packages (one or more of: `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`) into the virtual environment.

Note that `setuptools` and `wheel` are not included in Python 3.12+ environments.

May also be set with the `UV_VENV_SEED` environment variable.

[`--system-site-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--system-site-packages)

Give the virtual environment access to the system site packages directory.

Unlike `pip`, when a virtual environment is created with `--system-site-packages`, uv will _not_ take system site packages into account when running commands like `uv pip list` or `uv pip install`. The `--system-site-packages` flag will provide the virtual environment with access to the system site packages directory at runtime, but will not affect the behavior of uv commands.

[`--verbose`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-venv--verbose), `-v`

Use verbose output.

You can configure fine-grained logging using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. ( [https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing\_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives))

## [uv build](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-build)

Build Python packages into source distributions and wheels.

`uv build` accepts a path to a directory or source distribution, which defaults to the current working directory.

By default, if passed a directory, `uv build` will build a source distribution ("sdist") from the source directory, and a binary distribution ("wheel") from the source distribution.

`uv build --sdist` can be used to build only the source distribution, `uv build --wheel` can be used to build only the binary distribution, and `uv build --sdist --wheel` can be used to build both distributions from source.

If passed a source distribution, `uv build --wheel` will build a wheel from the source distribution.

### Usage

```
uv build [OPTIONS] [SRC]
```

### Arguments

[SRC](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--src)

The directory from which distributions should be built, or a source distribution archive to build into a wheel.

Defaults to the current working directory.

### Options

[`--all-packages`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--all-packages), `--all`

Builds all packages in the workspace.

The workspace will be discovered from the provided source directory, or the current directory if no source directory is provided.

If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--build-constraints`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--build-constraints), `--build-constraint`, `-b` _build-constraints_

Constrain build dependencies using the given requirements files when building distributions.

Constraints files are `requirements.txt`-like files that only control the _version_ of a build dependency that's installed. However, including a package in a constraints file will _not_ trigger the inclusion of that package on its own.

May also be set with the `UV_BUILD_CONSTRAINT` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--clear`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--clear)

Clear the output directory before the build, removing stale artifacts

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--color) _color-choice_

Control the use of color in output.

By default, uv will automatically detect support for colors when writing to a terminal.

Possible values:

- `auto`: Enables colored output only when the output is going to a terminal or TTY with support
- `always`: Enables colored output regardless of the detected environment
- `never`: Disables colored output

[`--config-file`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--config-file) _config-file_

The path to a `uv.toml` file to use for configuration.

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

[`--exclude-newer`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--exclude-newer) _exclude-newer_

Limit candidate packages to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts both RFC 3339 timestamps (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) and local dates in the same format (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

May also be set with the `UV_EXCLUDE_NEWER` environment variable.

[`--exclude-newer-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--exclude-newer-package) _exclude-newer-package_

Limit candidate packages for a specific package to those that were uploaded prior to the given date.

Accepts package-date pairs in the format `PACKAGE=DATE`, where `DATE` is an RFC 3339 timestamp (e.g., `2006-12-02T02:07:43Z`) or local date (e.g., `2006-12-02`) in your system's configured time zone.

Can be provided multiple times for different packages.

[`--extra-index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--extra-index-url) _extra-index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--index` instead) Extra URLs of package indexes to use, in addition to `--index-url`.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--index-url` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--extra-index-url` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

May also be set with the `UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--find-links`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--find-links), `-f` _find-links_

Locations to search for candidate distributions, in addition to those found in the registry indexes.

If a path, the target must be a directory that contains packages as wheel files (`.whl`) or source distributions (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.zip`) at the top level.

If a URL, the page must contain a flat list of links to package files adhering to the formats described above.

May also be set with the `UV_FIND_LINKS` environment variable.

[`--force-pep517`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--force-pep517)

Always build through PEP 517, don't use the fast path for the uv build backend.

By default, uv won't create a PEP 517 build environment for packages using the uv build backend, but use a fast path that calls into the build backend directly. This option forces always using PEP 517.

[`--fork-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--fork-strategy) _fork-strategy_

The strategy to use when selecting multiple versions of a given package across Python versions and platforms.

By default, uv will optimize for selecting the latest version of each package for each supported Python version (`requires-python`), while minimizing the number of selected versions across platforms.

Under `fewest`, uv will minimize the number of selected versions for each package, preferring older versions that are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms.

May also be set with the `UV_FORK_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `fewest`: Optimize for selecting the fewest number of versions for each package. Older versions may be preferred if they are compatible with a wider range of supported Python versions or platforms
- `requires-python`: Optimize for selecting latest supported version of each package, for each supported Python version

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--index) _index_

The URLs to use when resolving dependencies, in addition to the default index.

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

All indexes provided via this flag take priority over the index specified by `--default-index` (which defaults to PyPI). When multiple `--index` flags are provided, earlier values take priority.

Index names are not supported as values. Relative paths must be disambiguated from index names with `./` or `../` on Unix or `.\\`, `..\\`, `./` or `../` on Windows.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX` environment variable.

[`--index-strategy`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--index-strategy) _index-strategy_

The strategy to use when resolving against multiple index URLs.

By default, uv will stop at the first index on which a given package is available, and limit resolutions to those present on that first index (`first-index`). This prevents "dependency confusion" attacks, whereby an attacker can upload a malicious package under the same name to an alternate index.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_STRATEGY` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `first-index`: Only use results from the first index that returns a match for a given package name
- `unsafe-first-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, exhausting the versions from the first index before moving on to the next
- `unsafe-best-match`: Search for every package name across all indexes, preferring the "best" version found. If a package version is in multiple indexes, only look at the entry for the first index

[`--index-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--index-url), `-i` _index-url_

(Deprecated: use `--default-index` instead) The URL of the Python package index (by default: [https://pypi.org/simple](https://pypi.org/simple)).

Accepts either a repository compliant with PEP 503 (the simple repository API), or a local directory laid out in the same format.

The index given by this flag is given lower priority than all other indexes specified via the `--extra-index-url` flag.

May also be set with the `UV_INDEX_URL` environment variable.

[`--keyring-provider`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--keyring-provider) _keyring-provider_

Attempt to use `keyring` for authentication for index URLs.

At present, only `--keyring-provider subprocess` is supported, which configures uv to use the `keyring` CLI to handle authentication.

Defaults to `disabled`.

May also be set with the `UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disabled`: Do not use keyring for credential lookup
- `subprocess`: Use the `keyring` command for credential lookup

[`--link-mode`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--link-mode) _link-mode_

The method to use when installing packages from the global cache.

This option is only used when building source distributions.

Defaults to `clone` (also known as Copy-on-Write) on macOS, and `hardlink` on Linux and Windows.

WARNING: The use of symlink link mode is discouraged, as they create tight coupling between the cache and the target environment. For example, clearing the cache (`uv cache clean`) will break all installed packages by way of removing the underlying source files. Use symlinks with caution.

May also be set with the `UV_LINK_MODE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `clone`: Clone (i.e., copy-on-write) packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `copy`: Copy packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `hardlink`: Hard link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory
- `symlink`: Symbolically link packages from the wheel into the `site-packages` directory

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-binary`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--no-binary)

Do not create a `.gitignore` file in the output directory.

By default, uv creates a `.gitignore` file in the output directory to exclude build artifacts from version control. When this flag is used, the file will be omitted.

[`--no-index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--no-index)

Ignore the registry index (e.g., PyPI), instead relying on direct URL dependencies and those provided via `--find-links`

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

Defaults to the `dist` subdirectory within the source directory, or the directory containing the source distribution archive.

[`--package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--package) _package_

Build a specific package in the workspace.

The workspace will be discovered from the provided source directory, or the current directory if no source directory is provided.

If the workspace member does not exist, uv will exit with an error.

[`--prerelease`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--prerelease) _prerelease_

The strategy to use when considering pre-release versions.

By default, uv will accept pre-releases for packages that _only_ publish pre-releases, along with first-party requirements that contain an explicit pre-release marker in the declared specifiers (`if-necessary-or-explicit`).

May also be set with the `UV_PRERELEASE` environment variable.

Possible values:

- `disallow`: Disallow all pre-release versions
- `allow`: Allow all pre-release versions

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--python), `-p` _python_

The Python interpreter to use for the build environment.

By default, builds are executed in isolated virtual environments. The discovered interpreter
will be used to create those environments, and will be symlinked or copied in depending on
the platform.

See [uv python](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python) to view supported request formats.

May also be set with the `UV_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--quiet), `-q`

Refresh all cached data

[`--refresh-package`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--refresh-package) _refresh-package_

Refresh cached data for a specific package

[`--require-hashes`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--require-hashes)

Require a matching hash for each requirement.

By default, uv will verify any available hashes in the requirements file, but will not require that all requirements have an associated hash.

When `--require-hashes` is enabled, _all_ requirements must include a hash or set of hashes, and _all_ requirements must either be pinned to exact versions (e.g., `==1.0.0`), or be specified via direct URL.

Hash-checking mode introduces a number of additional constraints:

- Git dependencies are not supported. - Editable installations are not supported. - Local dependencies are not supported, unless they point to a specific wheel (`.whl`) or source archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`), as opposed to a directory.

May also be set with the `UV_REQUIRE_HASHES` environment variable.

[`--resolution`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--resolution) _resolution_

The strategy to use when selecting between the different compatible versions for a given package requirement.

Paths to the files to upload. Accepts glob expressions.

Defaults to the `dist` directory. Selects only wheels and source distributions, while ignoring other files.

### Options

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-publish--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-publish--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--check-url`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-publish--check-url) _check-url_

Check an index URL for existing files to skip duplicate uploads.

This option allows retrying publishing that failed after only some, but not all files have been uploaded, and handles errors due to parallel uploads of the same file.

Before uploading, the index is checked. If the exact same file already exists in the index, the file will not be uploaded. If an error occurred during the upload, the index is checked again, to handle cases where the identical file was uploaded twice in parallel.

The exact behavior will vary based on the index. When uploading to PyPI, uploading the same file succeeds even without `--check-url`, while most other indexes error. When uploading to pyx, the index URL can be inferred automatically from the publish URL.

The index must provide one of the supported hashes (SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512).

May also be set with the `UV_PUBLISH_CHECK_URL` environment variable.

[`--dry-run`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-publish--dry-run)

Perform a dry run without uploading files.

When enabled, the command will check for existing files if `--check-url` is provided, and will perform validation against the index if supported, but will not upload any files.

[`--help`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-publish--help), `-h`

Display the concise help for this command

[`--index`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-publish--index) _index_

```toml
[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
publish-url = "https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/"

### [uv cache prune](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/\#uv-cache-prune)

Prune all unreachable objects from the cache

### Usage

```
uv cache prune [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

[`--allow-insecure-host`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-cache-prune--allow-insecure-host), `--trusted-host` _allow-insecure-host_

Allow insecure connections to a host.

Can be provided multiple times.

Expects to receive either a hostname (e.g., `localhost`), a host-port pair (e.g., `localhost:8080`), or a URL (e.g., `https://localhost`).

WARNING: Hosts included in this list will not be verified against the system's certificate store. Only use `--allow-insecure-host` in a secure network with verified sources, as it bypasses SSL verification and could expose you to MITM attacks.

May also be set with the `UV_INSECURE_HOST` environment variable.

[`--cache-dir`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-cache-prune--cache-dir) _cache-dir_

Path to the cache directory.

Defaults to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/uv` or `$HOME/.cache/uv` on macOS and Linux, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` on Windows.

To view the location of the cache directory, run `uv cache dir`.

May also be set with the `UV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

[`--ci`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-cache-prune--ci)

Optimize the cache for persistence in a continuous integration environment, like GitHub Actions.

By default, uv caches both the wheels that it builds from source and the pre-built wheels that it downloads directly, to enable high-performance package installation. In some scenarios, though, persisting pre-built wheels may be undesirable. For example, in GitHub Actions, it's faster to omit pre-built wheels from the cache and instead have re-download them on each run. However, it typically _is_ faster to cache wheels that are built from source, since the wheel building process can be expensive, especially for extension modules.

In `--ci` mode, uv will prune any pre-built wheels from the cache, but retain any wheels that were built from source.

[`--color`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-cache-prune--color) _color-choice_

While uv configuration can be included in a `pyproject.toml` file, it is not allowed in this context.

May also be set with the `UV_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

[`--directory`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--directory) _directory_

Change to the given directory prior to running the command.

[`--managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--managed-python)

Require use of uv-managed Python versions.

By default, uv prefers using Python versions it manages. However, it will use system Python versions if a uv-managed Python is not installed. This option disables use of system Python versions.

May also be set with the `UV_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--native-tls`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--native-tls)

Whether to load TLS certificates from the platform's native certificate store.

By default, uv loads certificates from the bundled `webpki-roots` crate. The `webpki-roots` are a reliable set of trust roots from Mozilla, and including them in uv improves portability and performance (especially on macOS).

However, in some cases, you may want to use the platform's native certificate store, especially if you're relying on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

May also be set with the `UV_NATIVE_TLS` environment variable.

[`--no-cache`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--no-cache), `--no-cache-dir`, `-n`

May also be set with the `UV_NO_CONFIG` environment variable.

[`--no-managed-python`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--no-managed-python)

Disable use of uv-managed Python versions.

Instead, uv will search for a suitable Python version on the system.

May also be set with the `UV_NO_MANAGED_PYTHON` environment variable.

[`--no-progress`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--no-progress)

May also be set with the `UV_OFFLINE` environment variable.

[`--project`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--project) _project_

Run the command within the given project directory.

All `pyproject.toml`, `uv.toml`, and `.python-version` files will be discovered by walking up the directory tree from the project root, as will the project's virtual environment (`.venv`).

Other command-line arguments (such as relative paths) will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

See `--directory` to change the working directory entirely.

This setting has no effect when used in the `uv pip` interface.

May also be set with the `UV_PROJECT` environment variable.

[`--quiet`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-self-update--quiet), `-q`
