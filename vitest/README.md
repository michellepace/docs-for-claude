What is Vitest?

- **Vitest is a fast testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It works seamlessly with Vite and runs your tests instantly as you code, with built-in support for mocking, snapshots, and code coverage.**
- Vitest is a next-generation testing framework powered by Vite that provides a Jest-compatible API for unit and component testing. It shares the same configuration and transformation pipeline as your Vite application, enabling instant hot module reload during test development and eliminating the need for duplicate build configurations. The framework executes tests in parallel using Worker threads, includes built-in support for mocking, snapshots, code coverage, and browser mode testing, whilst maintaining watch mode by default for a developer-first experience.
